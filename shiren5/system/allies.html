            <p>Allies are mostly optional non-player characters who fight alongside Shiren.<br>Each character comes with a unique ability, and can grow stronger through leveling up.</p>
            <p>Those looking for a more classic roguelike experience can leave everyone except Jirokichi<br>behind during the main story, but considering most post-game dungeons don't allow allies,<br>it might be fun to experience them and see their abilities while you can.</p>

            <li>Allies must be unlocked before they can join your adventures.
              <ul>
                <li>The unlock conditions are generally pretty lax, with some characters simply joining<br>you automatically when you reach certain points of the main story.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Level ups for allies persist between adventures.
              <ul>
                <li>Due to this, they typically require more experience points to level up.</li>
                <li>It's best to use items like Cheery Grass or Angel Seed to level them up once they reach high levels.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Turn order: Shiren → Allies → Monsters.</li>
            <li>All allies except for Kojirouta prioritize following Shiren.</li>
            <li>They won't attack monsters who aren't an immediate threat. (example: napping or paralyzed monsters)</li>
            <li>Press Select to view their current HP.
              <ul>
                <li>You can also talk to them to get a rough idea, but note that talking is a turn ending action.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If an ally is defeated, the monster that defeated the ally levels up.</li>
            <li>Experience points are distributed to all party members regardless of who defeated the monster.
              <ul>
                <li>The amount of experience points doesn't change based on number of party members.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Allies follow you when you switch places with a wandering NPC.</li>
            <li>Doors wait to close until Shiren and all allies pass through the door.
              <ul>
                <li>However, blue doors still close immediately if a monster is present in the room you enter.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Except for Kojirouta, allies follow you to the next floor even if you were in different rooms on the previous floor.</li>
            <li>Levels can be gained or lost by level-changing items such as Cheery Grass or Unlucky Staff.
              <ul>
                <li>Koharu and allies who are in wandering NPC mode aren't affected.</li>
                <li>The most efficient way to level up allies:<br>1a. Use Fever Pots and blessed Extraction Scrolls to prepare lots of blessed Angel Seeds.<br>1b. Alternatively, register an Angel Seed as a New Item, and then purchase a bunch of that item.<br>2. Equip a Can. Arm Bracelet and enter a dungeon with 3 allies.<br>3. Line them up in a hallway and throw the Angel Seeds.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Herb, Otogiriso, Heal Grass, and Life Grass will restore HP when thrown at an ally.
              <ul>
                <li>Max HP won't increase when they're at full HP.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>They dodge flying equipment, include equipment disarmed by a Swordsman's special attack.</li>
            <li>The number of allies you can have with you depends on the dungeon, but it's usually 3 characters.</li>

              <li>She appears at the entrance to Tower of Fortune as part of the story,<br>and you're given the option to hire her as a guide for 1500G.<br>(If you decline, she'll raise the price to 2000G)</li>

              <li>Her special attack is a boomerang throw that deals fixed damage from a distance.

                  <li>It can hit enemies up to 8 tiles away, and she uses it 50% of the time if an enemy is in range.</li>
                  <li>The boomerang follows a square path, and pierces through walls and characters.</li>
                  <li>Damage dealt is equal to half of her max HP. (example: 50HP at level 1, so 25 damage)</li>
                  <li>It hits monsters like Cavel Mamel, Gitan Mamel, Mixer, Bored Kappa, Flamebird, and Sweet Nut for full damage.</li>
                  <li>She won't throw the boomerang at night.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>She'll offer to sell you an item at a marked up price if you talk to her when you're in need of help.
                <ul>
                  <li>If you have cursed or sealed items → Exorcism Scroll (1500G)</li>

                  <li>Note: You can only buy one type of item per floor, but can buy the same item multiple times.</li>

              <li>Low HP and collapses extremely easily, but offers a mix of debuffs and support.</li>
              <li>Joins you as an ally in Nekomaneki Village after you rescue a trapped fox in a dungeon.</li>
              <li class="ally_line">She's located near Ponta's Lot Shop in the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki.</li>
              <li>Prioritizes following Shiren at all times.
                <ul>
                  <li>If Shiren is in view, and she isn't adjacent to him, she'll move toward him.</li>

              </li>
              <li>She can transform into a monster and use its special attack.
                <ul>
                  <li>She starts with Blade Bee, and learns more transformations as she levels up.</li>
                  <li>She'll always use a transformation attack if the situation allows for it.<br>(example: Gazer if she's adjacent to an enemy that doesn't have a status condition)</li>
                  <li>You can enable or disable individual transformations by talking to her.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Generally, it's dangerous for her to have many transformations enabled at the same time<br>since she collapses so easily - the AI might choose to use an attacking transormation<br>instead of a transformation that disables an adjacent enemy.</li>
                      <li>If you're worried, it's best to only leave Naptapir (or Gazer) enabled for general play,<br>and toggle other transformations for one turn as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Blade Bee is her main method to deal with Gyazas and Absorbiphants.</li>
                  <li>Gazer is necessary to win (or even survive) 1-vs-1 fights until she learns Naptapir.</li>
                  <li>Moseal should be disabled at all times, since it places her away from Shiren.</li>
                  <li>DJ Mage can be handy to avoid fights at night or in single-room Monster Houses.</li>
                  <li>Curse Girl should be disabled at all times, since Okon will easily collapse if she's attacked.</li>
                  <li>Scoopie is excellent at disabling enemies in rooms, though note that it can miss.</li>
                  <li>Grass Boy is a decent long range option, but enemies can level up if she throws Rage Grass.</li>
                  <li>Absorbiphant offers fantastic support for Shiren, and greatly increases Okon's offense.</li>
                  <li>Naptapir should be enabled at all times, since it completely shuts down most enemies.</li>
                  <li>Flamebird should be used to restore HP after a fight, rather than enabling it while fighting.</li>

              <li>Ultimately becomes the strongest ally in terms of raw stats, but tricky to level up.</li>

                  <li>She can only transform into equipment one time per floor.</li>
                  <li>Doesn't gain exp by defeating enemies, but instead levels up when equipment level increases.</li>
                  <li>Upgrade value of Fox Kodachi is added to her attack.</li>
                  <li>Upgrade value of Fox Shield is added to her defense.</li>
                  <li>The transformation wears off if an effect other than increasing upgrade value occurs.<br>(If you try to tag the equipment, or the item is about to rust, turn into an onigiri, etc.)</li>
