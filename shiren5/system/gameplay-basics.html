            <h4>Turns and Turn-Ending Actions</h4>
            <p>
              Being a turn-based roguelike, Shiren and monsters take turns when performing actions.<br>
              Generally, turn-ending actions include movement, attacks, using an item, and stepping in place.<br>
              Your turn <span class="blue_text_2">does not</span> end from idling, checking item details, or otherwise navigating menus.<br><br>
              The following actions are easy to forget / mistake:
            </p>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Equipping a weapon, shield, or bracelet <span class="red_text">does</span> end the turn, but equipping a projectile or staff <span class="blue_text_2">does not</span>.</li>
              <li>Talking to an ally character or NPC <span class="red_text">does</span> end the turn.</li>
              <li>Setting a trap on the ground <span class="blue_text_2">does not</span> end the turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Turns Elapsing</h4>
            <p>
              Various effects and events occur based on the number of turns that have elapsed.<br>
              Do your best to avoid wasting turns with meaningless actions.
            </p>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Fullness decreases by 1 every 10 turns.</li>
              <li>Items that apply status conditions generally last a set number of turns.</li>
              <li>A new monster is generated every N turns. (N depends on the dungeon)</li>
              <li>A new enemy Shopkeep is generated every 5 turns when stealing from shops.</li>
              <li>Time of day changes between day and night. (Some dungeons are daytime-only)</li>
              <li>The Wind of Kron blows you out of the dungeon if you remain on one floor too long. (See next section)</li>
              <li>HP regenerates every turn at a rate dependent on your max HP.<br>Examples:<br>15~50 = 1, 2, 1, 2...<br>51~66 = 1, 1, 1, 2...<br>96~101 = 1, 1, 1, 1...<br>124 = 1, 1, 1, 0...<br>200+ = 1, 0, 1, 0...</li>

          <h3 id="wind-of-kron">Wind of Kron</h3>
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>
              If you remain on the same floor of a dungeon for a long time, a strong wind begins to blow.<br>
              The number of turns depends on the dungeon, but you'll have 3 warnings before being blown away.<br>
              You'll automatically fail the adventure and lose all items and Gitan if that happens.<br>
              If you can't make it to the exit in time, read an <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#escape-scroll">Escape Scroll</a> or eat <a href="/shiren5/item/grass#undo-grass">Undo Grass</a>.<br><br>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>
              Many dungeons switch between day and night based on the number of elapsed turns.<br>
              Day and night have their own monster tables, and all previous time of day monsters vanish<br>
              and the floor is populated with new monsters when time of day changes.<br>
              The background music changes based on time of day as well.
            </p>
            <p>Day</p>

              <li>Night monsters have unpredictable movement, and will attack any adjacent creature.</li>
              <li>
                Night monsters will limit break when they level up instead of moving to their next rank.
                <br>(example: Dark Mamel → Dark Mamel2)
              </li>
              <li>Can't use the Scout command unless you read a <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#navigation-scroll">Navigation Scroll</a> or <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#fixer-scroll">Fixer Scroll</a>.</li>
              <li>Items dropped by night monsters are always <a href="#blessing-curse-seal">blessed</a>, and are selected from the dungeon's shop table.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3 id="auras">Auras</h3>
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>
              Monsters sometimes have auras when they're generated naturally, including initial floor population.<br>
              They'll never have auras if they weren't generated in a natural manner, such as being summoned.<br>
              Whether or not monsters can generate with auras depends on the dungeon and specific floor.<br><br>
              Defeating monsters with auras grants double experience points, so take advantage of that when possible.<br>
              Auras can be removed by reading a <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#dispel-aura-scroll">Dispel Aura Scroll</a>, swinging a <a href="/shiren5/item/staves#seal-staff">Seal Staff</a>, or throwing <a href="/shiren5/item/talismans">Talismans</a>.<br>
              There are three types of auras: <span class="highlight_pink">Red</span>, <span class="highlight_blue_3">Blue</span>, and <span class="highlight_yellow">Yellow</span>.
            </p>
            <ul class="desc_list">

            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition, your direct attacks can randomly inflict Asleep, Confused, Blind, Paralyzed, Sealed,<br>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>Mechanic where you combine items to merge abilities, upgrade value, and use counts.</p>
            <h4>Synthesis Pot</h4>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Lets you combine weapons with weapons, shields with shields, and staves with staves.</li>
              <li>The first weapon or shield acts as a base, and upgrade value and <a href="/shiren5/system/runes">runes</a> of subsequent items transfer to it.<br>(example: Plain Targe+1 followed by Counter Shield+3 → Plain Targe+4 with the <span class="green_text">Retribution</span> rune)</li>
              <li>Staves must have the same name, and the number of uses will be added together.<br>(Useful to synthesize an identified staff with a staff that has an unknown number of uses)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mixer Monsters</h4>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Same as Synthesis Pot, but also lets you synthesize different category items together.<br>(example: Dragon Grass followed by Plain Targe+1 → Plain Targe+1 with the <span class="green_text">Anti-Fire</span> rune)</li>
              <li>Mixers won't swallow thrown items while afflicted by certain <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions">status conditions</a>.<br>　Won't swallow: Napping, Asleep, Sound Asleep, Sealed, Paralyzed, S-Paralyzed, Onigiri, Tottering.</li>
              <li>Mixers will turn toward the direction the thrown item came from when it swallows an item.</li>
              <li>Any swallowed items will be placed on the ground when time of day switches and the Mixer vanishes.</li>
              <li>See <a href="/shiren5/system/runes">Runes</a> for a list of item combinations to synthesize runes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Retaining Item Blessing, Curse, Seal, and Identification</h4>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Generally, the state of the synthesized item takes on the state of the item that was inserted or thrown last.<br>However, Mixer synthesis has priority based on item category, so you might end up with an undesired result.<br>(If a weapon ends up cursed or sealed, synthesize the weapon with an Iron Arrow to remove it)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="mixer-priority">Mixer Synthesis Priority</h4>
            <div class="explanation_2">
              <p class="warning_text">Note: Item category priority is still being researched.</p>
              <p>
                It seems Mixers synthesize items in a set order when multiple different category items are thrown after a weapon.<br>
                Weapons > Scrolls > Grass > Staves > Bracelets<br>
                This is the case no matter what order you throw items, so you may end up with unexpected results.<br>
                (Arrows, Talismans, and Pots haven't been checked yet)
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you throw a weapon → staff (sealed) → grass, the resulting item will still be sealed<br>because grass items have a higher synthesis priority than staves.<br>
                So in this case, you'd need to synthesize twice to remove the seal.<br>(weapon + staff, then weapon + grass)
              </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Common Mixer Synthesis Mistakes</h4>
            <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Throwing your main weapon or shield at a napping Mixer.<br>(Mixer mechanics changed from Shiren 4 onward, so always wake it up first)</li>
              <li>The synthesized item was blown up by a Pop Tank monster after defeating the Mixer.<br>(Always understand the risk of synthesizing on floors where Pop Tank monsters appear)</li>
              <li>Synthesizing staves resulted in a sealed staff.<br>(Always swing the staff you intend to synthesize last to verify that it's not sealed)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>
              Shops in villages or dungeons can place a tag on equipment for a fee.<br>
              Tagged equipment will be delivered to the Sentry in Hermit's Hermitage if you lose the item.<br>
              ※ You can only have up to 8 items tagged at the same time.<br>※ Mudkin monster special attacks can sometimes remove tags, so be careful.

          <h3 id="blessing-curse-seal">Blessing / Curse / Seal</h3>
          <div class="explanation">
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Blessed items are worth 10% more Gitan, and cursed or sealed items are worth 80% of their regular value.</li>
            <li>
              Blessed bracelets and pots are protected from being cursed, sealed, or turned into onigiri.<br>
              The blessing has a chance to wear off: "But X was fine because it was blessed." - Curse Trap, Curse Scroll, Nigiri Morph<br>
              The blessing won't wear off: "...But the Curse was ineffective." - Curse Girls
            </li>
