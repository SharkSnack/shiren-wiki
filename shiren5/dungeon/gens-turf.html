          <h3 id="trapper-status">Trapper Status</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Shiren has Trapper Status at all times in this dungeon, which has the following characteristics:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Traps don't trigger when Shiren walks on them, and he can pick them up instead. (Can manually step on them to trigger them)</li>
            <li>Picked up traps are added to your inventory, and are placed using the Drop and DropFwd commands. (Doesn't end turn)</li>
            <li>Placed traps have a red mark in the lower right corner, and can't be picked up again.</li>
            <li>Enemies that step on traps will trigger them, and monsters hit by thrown traps will receive the effect of the trap.
              <ul>
                <li>Floating type monsters will also receive the effect of a trap if one is thrown at them.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="duelist-trap">Duelist Trap</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>A special trap called "Duelist Trap" appears in this dungeon.<br>Monsters that step on this trap gain <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#dueling">Dueling</a> status for a limited amount of time, including Floating type monsters.</p>
            <p>Dueling status grants a chance for the dueling monster to drop a Monster License when defeated,<br>and this status can't be absorbed by Absorbiphant family monsters.</p>
            <p>Duelist Traps won't break if they haven't been picked up, but placed Duelist Traps will always break after a single use.<br>If you want to collect Monster Licenses, always lure monsters onto a Duelist Trap that hasn't been picked up.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="monster-license">Monster License</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Monster Licenses (Monster-specific Friendship Licenses) cause that monster family to act as allies and attack enemy monsters.<br>(example: "Mamel Lic." in your inventory causes Mamel, Pit Mamel, Cave Mamel, and Gitan Mamel to act as allies)</p>
            <p>Ally monsters won't be attacked by enemies, and won't level up when they defeat other monsters. (Shiren won't gain exp)<br>If Shiren deals damage to an ally monster, all Monster Licenses for that family are destroyed, including those in pots.<br>Licenses that are inside pots won't be active, and licenses on the ground won't be active either.</p>
            <p>When you're carrying a Monster License for a monster that appears on the current floor, and advance to the next floor,<br>a "Blank Scroll check" occurs, which causes a license to transform into a Blank Scroll if it succeeds. (Including licenses in pots)<br>For example, if you're carrying a Mamel Lic., a check is performed when you advance from:<br>"1F to 2F", "2F to 3F", "3F to 4F", "4F to 5F", "5F to 6F", "6F to 7F", and "7F to 8F".</p>
            <p>Maneater Lic. will only have a Blank Scroll check when you change floors after they start spawning on the current floor.</p>
            <p>The chance for a Monster License to turn into a Blank Scroll seems to be somewhere between 10~20%.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
          <h3 id="general">General</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>This dungeon is extremely unique, and many of the strategies used in other dungeons aren't needed.<br>Instead, you'll want to learn Gen's Turf specific item collection techniques, and decision making for what items to keep.<br>Some luck plays into it related to Blank Scroll checks and finding pots, but you can usually clear the 99F version<br>without much issue if you stick to the outlined strategies, and you'll take home lots of Blank Scrolls and a set of +99 equipment.</p>
            <p>If you're only aiming for the first clear (30F), go around the map to collect items and traps that help with run-away play,<br>and then start rushing for the stairs. Staves are found identified, so it's generally not very difficult to escape situations.<br>You don't need to go out of your way to obtain Monster Licenses, but it helps to obtain licenses for strong monsters.</p>
            <p>If you're aiming for 99F, you'll want to collect Monster Licenses early game to make Blank Scrolls, and then<br>read a Mnster House Scrl to collect more items and traps. This is usually repeated on every floor until around 20F.<br>The main idea is to use Fate, Earth, and blessed Extraction scrolls to strengthen equipment to +99,<br>and then obtain multiple licenses for troublesome enemies like Bored Kappa, Dragon, Fearabbit,<br>and finally read Navigation Scroll and Immunity Scroll to rush stairs until 99F.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="progressing">Progressing</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Use Duelist Traps on 1F to collect as many Monster Licenses as you can.<br>It's fine to eat the Large Onigiri on this floor, so stay until your fullness depletes to around 60. (1400 turns)<br>You'll want a minimum of 6 licenses, and to have at least 1 of them change into a Blank Scroll when you advance to 2F.</p>
            <p>From 2F onward, write <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#mnster-house-scrl">Mnster House Scrl</a> on a Blank Scroll to collect even more items.<br>The only items you need are a main weapon and shield, bracelets, pots to hold licenses, and food.<br>There's no need to carry around grasses, talismans, or staves.</p>
            <p>Food will likely be scarce for a while starting on 2F, so use Decay Traps + Explosion Traps to create Grilled Onigiri.<br>Onigiri Traps + Explosion Traps can also be used, but it's trickier to perform since <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#onigiri">Onigiri</a> status wears off over time.<br>Try to increase max fullness at this point, and be sure to carry Decary Traps and Explosion Traps as backup early on.</p>
            <p>Once you have some food stocked up, you can collect licenses until the wind blows on each floor.<br>Insert licenses into any pots that can hold them, including Synthesis Pots. (Treat them like Ordinary Pots)</p>
            <p>Keeping or discarding specific Monster Licenses is a constant decision making exercise due to the Blank Scroll check.<br>Check the monster table, and prioritize monster families that appear across a longer floor range than others,<br>and discard licenses if the target monster family won't appear again until much later.</p>
            <p>When inserting licenses into pots other than Preservation Pots, it's best to group them by monster family<br>in an effort to avoid having to sort inventory items when you shatter the pot to retrieve Blank Scrolls.</p>
            <p>Once you have a lot of Blank Scrolls, perform blessed Extraction Scroll loops to increase pot capacity and upgrade equipment.</p>
            <p>After you're done upgrading equipment, collect licenses for more Blank Scrolls, and aim to obtain mutliple copies of licenses<br>for troublesome monsters for the second half. (Dragons, Bored Kappas, Fearabbits, Tiger Tossers, Item Knaves, etc.)<br>Basically, focus on monsters with dangerous special attacks that can't be nullified by reading an Immunity Scroll.<br>Duelist Traps stop appearing from 70F, so use Nixer Scrolls instead if you need licenses for these monsters late game.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Blessed Extraction Scroll Loop</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Technique where you read a blessed Extraction Scroll on a pot to bless its contents while including another Extraction Scroll.<br>The pot (capacity of 5) should have 4 scrolls you want to reuse, along with an Extraction Scroll (or Blank Scroll) inside.<br>After reading a blessed Extraction Scroll on the pot, you can reuse the 4 scrolls 1 time each, and can repeat the technique.<br>If you have a Blessing Pot, you can read a regular Extraction Scroll on the Blessing Pot with 5 scrolls you want to reuse instead.<br>※ It's technically not a loop since the Extraction Scroll is consumed, but it's just easier to call it that to get the idea across.</p>
            <p>The following scrolls are used in blessed Extraction Scroll loops for Gen's Turf:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
              <li>Blessing Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Often needed to begin the technique, and you can never have too many of these scrolls.<br>It's better to bless multiple Blessing Scrolls instead of specific scrolls since they can be used on other items.<br>(example: Go with Fate Scroll x 1 and Blessing Scroll x 3 instead of Fate Scroll x 4)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fate Scroll, Earth Scroll, Darth Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>The main focus of this technique, and used to upgrade a weapon and shield to +99 in this dungeon.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Mnster House Scrl
                <ul>
                  <li>Lets you obtain lots of traps and items, and should be read on each floor until at least 10F.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Pot God Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Increase the capacity of Preservation and Blessing pots.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fixer Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Fully restores fullness if read while starving.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Onigiri Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Alternative to Fixer Scroll, if you want to keep <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#super">Super</a> status.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Immunity Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Used to hunt Maneaters early game, and to secure safety on every floor during the second half.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Navigation Scroll
                <ul>
                  <li>Useful for locating monsters while collecting Monster Licenses, and for locating the stairs during the second half.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          <h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
          <h4>Weapon / Shield</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Type effective weapons can't be found on the ground, and shops are incredibly rare, so you don't have many options.<br>Ordinary Stick + Plain Targe is the ideal set since it has a high starting max upgrade value, levels up quickly,<br>and gains the CR Diet rune once it reaches Lv8.</p>
            <p>Two bracelet resonance is a low priority in this dungeon, and it's easy to earn equipment experience points by hunting<br>Maneaters and keeping Super status active, so it's fine to switch to mismatching equipment with higher base stats.<br>That said, Dotanuki + Wolfshead and Beast Fang + Beast Shield sets can be found somewhat commonly, and the<br>Bladite + Targite set can also rarely be found on the ground, so you shouldn't be stuck with weak equipment.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Runes</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>You can brute force your way through the dungeon with upgrade value and Blank Scrolls, so runes aren't too important.<br>However, some shield runes are nice to have, so focus on adding the following runes:</p>
          </div>
          <dl>
            <dt>Anti-Theft, Anti-Burgle, Anti-Peck</dt>
            <dd>Makes it easier to collect Zalokleft, Froggo, and Gyadon licenses.<br>Lock Shield, Safe Shield, and Gyadon Blocker can be found on the ground, so they're easy to synthesize.</dd>
            <dt>CR Diet</dt>
            <dd>Plain Targe can only be found on the ground until 5F, so you'll have to obtain it from a Presto Pot if you didn't find one.<br>Diet Shield can't be found on the ground, but can be dropped by Maneater family monsters.</dd>
            <dt>Unmoving</dt>
            <dd>Steady Shield and Heavy Shield are both shop-exclusive, so you'll usually have to obtain them from Maneaters.<br>Useful for collecting Fearabbit, Tiger Tosser, Yanpii family and DJ Mage licenses.</dd>
            <dt>Anti-Blast</dt>
            <dd>Blast Shield can't be found on the ground, but the rune can be added by leveling a Lock Shield or Safe Shield to Lv8.<br>It's nice to have this as insurance since Explochins explode in a chain-reaction when hit by an Explosion Trap.<br>If you're concerned about Pop Tank family monsters, aim to add this rune when Mixers first appear. (9-10F)</dd>
            <dt>Anti-Fire</dt>
            <dd>Dragon Grass can only be obtained from a Presto Pot or shop, and Snake Shield is exclusive to elite shops.</dd>
            <dt>Magi-Twister</dt>
            <dd>Binary Shield isn't in this dungeon's item table, so you can't add Magi-Twister by leveling up a shield,<br>and Swap Shield is exclusive to elite shops, so it's difficult to obtain this rune.</dd>
          </dl>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ Keep in mind that Mixers you see walking around might have stepped on arrow traps,<br>　so it's safer to synthesize using Mixers that were napping.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Bracelets</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>There are few options, and Monster Detector (Monsterphobic) and Item Detector (Itemphobic) aren't in the item table.<br>Immunity Scroll is an option, so prioritize bracelets that block special attacks that can't be blocked by Immune status,<br>or that let you conserve Blessing Scrolls that get used for the purpose of blessing Immunity Scrolls.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that carrying bracelets wastes inventory slots that could be used to carry more licenses,<br>so if you choose to use them, discard them once you get past the floor range where the target monsters appear.</p>
          </div>
          <dl>
            <dt>Cleansing Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Mainly used for Mutaikon floors (9-14F), and is one of the more important bracelets.<br>Also useful if you perform <a href="/guide/tips-and-tricks#grass-factory">Grass Factory</a> mid game.</dd>
            <dt>Anti-Cnf. Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Useful for Blade Bee floors (3-6F, 16-20F, 30-35F, 60-64F) and Dazikon floors (34-37F).<br>MC Mage (29-32F) and MC Wizard (36-39F) floors overlap a bit, so you'll end up reading Immunity Scrolls anyway.</dd>
            <dt>Alert Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Useful for Naptapir floors (9-12F, 24-27F, 50-54F, 67-70F) and Dozikon floors (65-68F, 81-83F).<br>MC Sorceror (51-55F) overlaps with Doztapir, and some prefer Immunity Scrolls for 65-68F since Gazers appear.</dd>
            <dt>Can. Arm Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Useful for getting rid of unneeded items and traps to make it easier to collect Bored Kappa and Zalokleft licenses.</dd>
            <dt>Anti-Crs. Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Useful for Curse Girl floors (8-10F, 22-26F, 56-58F, 73-77F, 90-92F).<br>However, it's shop-exclusive, and tends to waste an inventory slot since Curse Girl family floors are far apart.</dd>
            <dt>Staunch Bracelet</dt>

          <dl>
            <dt>Arrows, Rocks, Grass, Staves, Talismans</dt>
            <dd>Typically not used if you're progressing through the dungeon while collecting Blank Scrolls.<br>You won't need these items for run-away play if you've upgraded your equipment,<br>so only carry what you need to make collecting licenses easier.</dd>
            <dt>Scrolls</dt>
            <dd>Keep any scrolls you find that are listed in the earlier blessed Extraction Scroll loop section, and discard the rest.<br>Remember, you have Blank Scrolls if you need to cover other situations.</dd>
            <dt>Pots</dt>
            <dd>Preservation Pot is the key item for this dungeon, and always expand capacity to 5 using Pot God Scrolls.<br>Synthesis, Exorcism, and Ordinary pots are used to carry licenses and Blank Scrolls, and Blessing Pot lets<br>you conserve Blank Scrolls by using a regular Extraction Scroll instead of having to bless one each time.<br>Dodger and Zen pots can be handy, but you can use licenses to counter monsters with applicable special attacks.</dd>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>This dungeon makes use of traps, but as mentioned earlier, you can clear it by using Blank Scrolls and licenses.<br>The only traps worth carrying are Decay and Explosion traps to secure food early game, and the rest are a waste of space.<br>...But perhaps you want to use traps instead, so this section covers traps while assuming Blank Scrolls aren't being used.</p>
            <p>Traps generated on the ground from the start of the floor won't break when enemies step on them.<br>Once a trap is picked up and placed on the ground, you can't pick it up again, and it has a chance to break after it triggers.<br>It seems traps vary in how likely they are to break. For example, a placed Duelist Trap always breaks after a single use.</p>
            <p>Traps can't be blessed, cursed, or sealed, and can't be turned into Gitan using a Sale Scroll, but can be turned into an onigiri.<br>They'll turn into a different trap when inserted into a Presto Pot, and will activate fragrance pots when inserted into them.<br>It's best to place stat lowering traps on room entrance tiles, and status inflicting traps near Duelist Traps.</p>
            <p>See <a href="/shiren5/system/traps">Traps</a> for details about traps that aren't listed below.</p>

            <dt>Pit</dt>
            <dd>By far the best trap in the dungeon, but rarely gets generated.<br>Lets you steal, escape a bad situation, or simply advance to the next floor without risk.<br>Only has a chance to appear until 30F.</dd>
            <dt>Spring</dt>
            <dd>Used like Warp Grass.<br>Be careful of placement, since enemies also warp if they step on it.</dd>
            <dt>Decay</dt>
            <dd>Used alongside Sweet Nut explosions or Explosion / Big Explosion traps to create Grilled Onigiri.<br>It's also the best offensive trap, and works on Absorbiphants.</dd>
            <dt>Explosion, Big Explosion</dt>
            <dd>Halves the HP of the creature that stepped on it, along with all creatures in a 1 tile radius. (Big Explosion reduces HP to 1)<br>Often used to soften enemies so that they can be defeated with a single direct attack, and works on Gyazas.<br>Can also be used to grill onigiri or destroy wall tiles.</dd>
            <dt>Onigiri</dt>
            <dd>Useful for hunting Maneaters, and neutralizing high level enemies for experience points early on.<br>Can be used alongside a Log Trap on floors with water tiles to create Rotten Onigiri.<br>Breaks easily when placed, so make use of traps that were already on the ground.<br>Nigiri Baby family monsters will gain <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#buffed">Buffed</a> status if they step on it.<br>If you don't need it, throw it at an enemy standing on a water tile.</dd>
            <dt>Slow</dt>
            <dd>Lets you safely defeat enemies using hit-and-away tactics.<br>Unlike previous games, action speed changes last the entire duration of the current floor for monsters.</dd>
            <dt>Wood Arrow, Iron Arrow, Poison Arrow</dt>
            <dd>Place it next to a wall and throw an item onto the trap to collect arrows.<br>On floors where Sweet Nuts appear, step on it yourself so that the Sweet Nut eats arrows<br>to increase experience points / change Rotten Onigiri into Grilled Onigiri.<br>Wood and Iron arrow traps only appear until 30F, and projectiles can't be found on the ground in this dungeon.</dd>
            <dt>Duelist</dt>
            <dd>Used to obtain Monster Licenses.<br>Breaks after 1 activation when placed, but will never break if it was already on the ground.<br>Works on all monsters, including Floating types and Absorbiphant, Gyaza, Sproutant families.<br>Its chance to be generated decreases as you progress through the dungeon, and stops appearing from 70F.</dd>
