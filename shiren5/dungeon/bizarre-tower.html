            <p>Dungeon where you progress through 15 floor ranges using special rules in the order of your choice.<br>It's balanced so that the quality of items generally increases the further you progress.</p>
            <p>The dungeon includes both day and night, but time of day doesn't change to night based on elapsed turns.<br>Field of view isn't restricted during the day with the exception of Monster House floor ranges,<br>and Monster Houses are never generated naturally outside of Monster House floor ranges.</p>
            <p>There are 15 stairs representing floor ranges at the start, and you're free to challenge them in any order.<br>Any given floor range can only be chosen once, and you must go through all 15 floor ranges to clear the dungeon.<br></p>
            <p>Stairs in red have a higher difficulty:</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Mixers appear between 8-10F, so plan a route that lets you collect items for synthesis prior to reaching that floor range.</p>
            <p>Synthesis Pots are somewhat common, so if you're not struggling with synthesis, it's best to save the Mixer stairs<br>for the second half to get past floor ranges where trickier monsters normally spawn. (example: Ornery Tanks between 33-35F)<br>This greatly lowers the chance of encountering troublesome monsters, since the majority of spawns turn into Mixer monsters.</p>
            <p>The Mixer floor range has a unique monster table. (30F+ is Mixermon, <span class="warning_text">Mixergon</span>, Kappa Pest, Green Zalokleft, and Concusschin)</p>
            <p>Food, staves, and talismans can only be found on the ground within stairs 9-15 (See table in the first section),<br>so don't forget to check your remaining staff uses and food prior to choosing a new floor range.<br>Also, Gitan can only be found on the ground within stairs 8-12, so it's nice to visit 8-11 before 12.<br>However, stairs 9-10 are dangerous zones, so don't overdo it for the sake of Gitan.</p>
            <p>Special Monster Houses are generated pretty often in Bizarre Tower,<br>so consider ignoring Monster Houses if you didn't start in one / if the stairs isn't located in one.<br>Doing so lowers risk, and lets you check other rooms without encountering many enemies.</p>
            <p>It's good to visit stairs 1-2 after you've obtained Synthesis Pots or when it overlaps with natural Mixer spawns,<br>since you'll be able to synthesize the weapons and shields you find right away.</p>

            <p>See <a href="/shiren5/guide/identifying">Identifying</a> for identification tips.</p>

          <h3 id="early_game">Early Game</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It's best to tackle Monster House floors early on, since HP regenerates quickly and dangerous monsters don't appear at first.<br>You'll also be able to collect a variety of items in time for the first Mixer zone (8-10F), helping with consistency.<br>However, Special Monster Houses are common, so expect to restart a number of times before things go smoothly.<br>For that reason, some players like to wait until they're able to defeat Mixers before attempting Monster House floors.</p>
            <p>Maps between 6-10F don't have walls if they're Monster House floors, making it hard to collect arrows using Karakuroids (6-8F).<br>Therefore, some players like to postpone Monster House floors until after 8F so that they can collect more arrows.</p>
            <p>Choose floors where HP doesn't regenerate around the time your HP regeneration slows down.<br>Check for traps and take things one step at a time, ideally keeping Super status active throughout the floors.<br>It's best to go after visiting stairs 3 (only grass) so you can stock up on Perception Grass and HP restoring grasses beforehand.</p>
            <p>That said, it's not necessarily a bad idea to tackle stairs 9 and 10 right away.<br>You should be able to defeat most enemies in 1 or 2 hits in stairs 9, and you'll hardly take damage if you find a shield.<br>Monsters hit somewhat hard starting from 3F, so aim for a shield with at least 10 defense if possible.</p>
            <p>Wood Arrow Traps appear between 1-5F, so walk along walls and check for traps to collect arrows.<br>The number of arrows you collect and strength of equipment comes down to luck when attempting stairs 10 early,<br>so if you don't find what you need pretty quickly, you'll likely end up collapsed.</p>
            <p>εFO-UZZ can spawn on all floors during the night, and always drops blessed Revival Grass when defeated,<br>so another option is to proceed through stairs 11 early on in hopes of obtaining Revival Grass.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="mid_game">Mid Game</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Avoid 3 (grass), 6-7 (pots), and 14-15 (Monster Houses) between Digestiphant (29-30F) and Kappa Pest (29-31F) floors.<br>Kappa Pest makes it difficult to collect items, so choose stairs that don't include valuable item categories.<br>Note that stairs 8 (only Gitan) is safe on Kappa Pest floors, since Lv2 Bored Kappas don't throw Gitan.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="late_game">Late Game</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Stairs 13 (Mixer monsters) can spawn powerful Mixergons starting on 30F, so it's usually not worth the risk to synthesize.<br>On the other hand, if you're prepared to rush stairs, choose stairs 13 when it overlaps with floors with dangerous enemies.<br>Examples: Ornery Tank (33-35F), MC Wizard (37-38F).</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Only weapons and shields on the ground. (1 floor, 3 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Popular choice to start with since you're guaranteed to find equipment.</li>
            <li>Status inflicting weapons can't be found on the ground, so upgrade value will be the focus if chosen before Mixers (8-10F).</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Only grass on the ground. (3 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy rule since grasses are identified in this dungeon, but don't choose it when Grass Boy monsters appear.</li>
            <li>Save Perception Grass you find for "HP doesn't regenerate, and lots of traps." floors.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice to overlap it with the first Mixer zone (8-10F).</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Only scrolls on the ground. (1 floor, 3 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Scrolls are unidentified, and bad scrolls like Swift Foe and Pot Dog can be found, so read scrolls while standing on the exit.</li>
            <li>It's somewhat uncommon to find 2 copies of a scroll due to the large variety of scrolls that can be found,<br>so it's best to prepare a way to identify them without using them.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Only pots on the ground. (1 floor, 3 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Preservation Pots to expand inventory, Identify Pots to help identify other items, Fever Pots to duplicate items, etc.</li>
            <li>Some like to start with Preservation Pots rather than wait until their inventory is full, but it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li>Zalokleft Pots can also be found, so one option is to visit this zone before choosing the "Stores appear." floors.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Only Gitan on the ground. (4 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Generally chosen before visiting the "Stores appear." floors.</li>
            <li>Gitan bags you find typically range between 400-500G, so you can't use them to one-shot late game monsters.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>HP doesn't regenerate, and lots of traps. (2 floors, 4 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Perception Grass and Trap Deletion Scrl make the "lots of traps" portion a non-issue.</li>
            <li>It's recommended to tackle these floors mid to late game, since HP regeneration slows down with higher max HP.</li>
            <li>However, as mentioned earlier, some players prefer to clear them early while enemies aren't very threatening.</li>
            <li>This floor range is also one of the few locations where Trap Del. Staff has a chance to shine.</li>
            <li>So all said, it's up to you whether you want to tackle these early, or wait until the later when you can rush stairs.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It's always night. (3 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Generally a bonus zone if you have a good set of <a href="/shiren5/system/abilities">abilities</a>, but there are some dangerous floors such as 41-43F.</li>
            <li>Some like to get these floors over with in the first half so that they don't need to carry torches.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Stores appear. (2 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Nice option for the first Mixer zone (8-10F), since price identification lets you figure out possible synthesis ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also a solid choice when you've collected lots of unidentified items and lack items to identify them in general.</li>
            <li>Don't choose this floor range if dangerous monsters appear, since you might not have the leeway to shop.</li>
            <li>If you're unlucky, the generated shops could be elite shops, meaning you won't be able to enter.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Mostly Mixer family monsters spawn. (5 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Can be used to avoid floor ranges with troublesome monsters by turning most enemies into Mixer family monsters.</li>
            <li>Be warned that higher level Mixers have high attack, so don't get careless trying to synthesize.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Monster Houses appear. (3 floors, 7 floors)</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Encountering a Special Monster House near the start often ends the run, but waiting until the end can also be risky.</li>
            <li>One counterplay would be to equip a torch and check what monsters are present before entering the room.</li>
            <li>Some players go with 7 floors of Monster Houses right away, and then synthesize using Mixers afterward.</li>
            <li>Others who like a thrill can choose these stairs last to enjoy 10 floors of late game Monster Houses.</li>
            <li>In any case, it's best to avoid Tiger Tosser and Pumphantasm floors if challenging these stairs near the beginning.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
          <h4>Weapon</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Status inflicting weapons can only be found in shops, so they aren't likely to be a main weapon option.<br>Weapons that activate 2 bracelet resonance are solid choices, since many effective bracelets can be found on the ground.<br>Bladite and Red Blade are shop-exclusive, so you'll typically end up with a Dotanuki, Beast Fang, or Katana set.</p>
            <p>Water Cutter or Scythe makes for an effective main weapon as well, but the other type effective weapons are a bit lackluster.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Weapon Runes</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Prioritize status inflicting runes. (Paralyzing, Sedating, Boring, Confusing, etc.)<br>Anti-Aquatic and Anti-Floating are particularly effective among type effective runes, and Anti-Metal is nice for Ornery Tank.<br>Have a Karakuroid (6-8F) create an Iron Arrow Trap to obtain an Iron Arrow for synthesis purposes.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Shield</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Targite and Red Shield are shop-exclusive, so you'll often end up with a Wolfshead, Beast Shield, or Iron Targe set.<br>Binary Shield makes for an effective main shield as well, provided you don't care to activate 2 bracelet resonance.<br>If you visit stairs 12 (Stores appear) near the beginning and find a Day Shield, don't hesitate to use it.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Shield Runes</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Anti-Blast, Bit, Agile, and Anti-Theft are solid choices.<br>This dungeon only has a depth of 45 floors, so others like Anti-Fire, Anti-Peck, and Rustproof<br>aren't essential because level 3~4 Dragons, Gyadons, Mudkins, etc. don't make an appearance.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Bracelets</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Monster Detector and Item Detector can be found on the ground, so pick up every unidentified bracelet.<br>If you start with Monster House floors, use traps such as Strip, Spin, and Sleep to safely equip and test for effects.<br>You can also visit stairs 12 (Stores appear) after you've collected a decent number of bracelets and try to identify by price,<br>or if you understand the risks of equipping a cursed bracelet, go ahead and equip them on the spot.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="other-items">Other Items</h3>
          <h4>Projectiles</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Collect arrows using wood, iron, and poison arrow traps found in Monster Houses or created by Karakuroids (6-8F).<br>Poison Arrows make late game encounters easier, and you'll want at least 1 Iron Arrow for synthesis purposes.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Scrolls</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Your chances to identify by price are limited, so you'll likely have to read the scroll or use an Identify Scroll or Identify Pot.<br>Scrolls with negative effects are common, so it's recommended to read scrolls while standing on the exit.<br>Simply reading a Pot Dog Scroll near the beginning of the adventure can end the run.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Staves</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Swap and Pinning staves are effective on floors that don't have walls.<br>It's nice to have them for Monster House floor ranges in particular, since map generation changes in some cases.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Pots</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Preservation, Heal, and fragrance pots are the essentials.<br>Fever Pots can be found on the ground, making them easier to obtain.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Talismans</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Throwing a talisman carries some risk, but they're nice to have since scrolls are harder to identify in this dungeon.<br>Sleep and Fear talismans are recommended, since they effectively shut down most monsters.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Grass</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It's good to carry some HP restoring grasses until you obtain items like Revival Grass, Swift Grass, and Heal Pot.<br>There's little need to carry other grasses, but Perception Grass is nice for floor ranges where HP doesn't regenerate.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="floor-guide">Floor Guide</h2>
          <h4>6-8F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Karakuroids appear, so collect arrows.<br>Remember, you need 1 Iron Arrow to add the <span class="green_text">Anti-Metal</span> rune to your weapon.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>6-10F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Maps in this floor range won't have walls if you choose stairs 14 or 15 (Monster Houses appear).<br>It's easy to collect items for synthesis going with Monster House floors, but it's trickier to collect arrows using traps.</p>
            <p>Field of view is limited on Monster House floors, meaning you risk getting items cursed by Curse Girls in hallways,<br>and Fearabbits inside Monster Houses can end a run if you don't clear out enemies using arrows beforehand.<br>So all said, understand the added risk of choosing stairs 14 and 15 early on.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>24-27F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Powerful enemies like Ironhead, Hipadile, Punisher, etc. begin to appear, so don't hesitate to use Poison Arrows.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>33-35F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Ornery Tanks make an appearance, so rush stairs unless you have a way to deal with them.<br>One strategy is to choose stairs 11 (It's always night) to skip past them, but be warned that Evil Poofy appears on 33F.<br>Another option is the choose stairs 13 (Mostly Mixer family monsters), but Mixergon can be quite a threat too.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>36F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>This floor is low risk you have Rocks to deal with Cave Mamels, so hunt Grass Guys to stock up on grass.<br>That said, VeniScorp also appears, so be careful not to get stung if you don't have an Antidote Grass or Peach.<br>Reading an Immunity Scroll can also reduce the risk of accidents if you plan on lingering a long time.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>37-38F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>MC Wizards make an appearance, so rush stairs unless you have a way to deal with them.<br>Similar to Ornery Tanks, one strategy is to save stairs 11 (It's always night) until this floor range to skip past them,<br>but Bad Colocolums defeated by other night monsters can one-shot you by rolling into you if you're unlucky.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>40-45F</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>This floor range is particularly dangerous at night.<br>41-43F includes Dark Scarabbit, Vile Pumpanshee, and Sinister Porkon as major threats.<br>44-45F is a bit better, but Dark Ornery Tanks appear so don't let your guard down too much.</p>
            <p>For daytime, monsters to watch out for include Nashagga (40-42F), Sky Dragons (41-43F), and Nigiri Boss (44-45F).</p>
            <p>Some players prefer to save stairs 13 (Mostly Mixer family monsters) until this final stretch to have an easier time.</p>
