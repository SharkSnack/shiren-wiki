          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Stealing is where you obtain items from a shop without having to pay for the items,<br>or sell all of your items and steal them back to obtain lots of Gitan.</p>
            <p>It's often a requirement when you use equipment like <a href="/shiren5/item/weapons#dirk-of-debts">Dirk of Debts</a> and <a href="/shiren5/item/shields#paupers-plank">Pauper's Plank</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
          <h3 id="risk-return">Risk and Return</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>There are some situations where there's no merit to stealing,<br>so consider what you'll be getting out of it before going through with it.</p>
            <p>If you have enough Gitan to purchase only the items you want, it might be best to just purchase those items.<br>There's also significant risk when you don't have a Monster Detector, Monsterphobic, or Scout Bracelet.<br>That said, if you spot a key item that nearly promises clearing the dungeon early game, it's often worth the try.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="stairs">Location of Stairs</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Stealing is easier when there's less distance between the shop and stairs.<br>Creating shortcuts using pickaxes and Boring Staff can be very effective,<br>and if the stairs is along a wall, you can dig straight lines and use a Pinning Staff.</p>
            <p>If there aren't many rooms, or you don't have anything on hand to help create a path,<br>you can attempt to warp to the stairs using Warp Grass or a Pinning Staff onto a water or air tile.<br>However, there's far too much luck involved with warping to be practical, so it's not recommended.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="shopkeeps">Position of Shopkeeps</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Shopkeeps have incredible attack power, and you'll need roughly 170 HP (red, blue), 180 HP (green),<br>or 200 HP (gold) to survive even a single hit, so knowing where they're located is very important.</p>
            <p>Use items like Monster Detector, Monsterphobic, Scout Bracelet, or Navigation Scroll to reveal their positions.<br>Be warned that all monsters on the current floor become Shopkeeps the moment you trigger Thief Mode,<br>and all Shopkeeps ignore Sanctuary Scrolls.</p>
            <p>Enemies generally don't spawn in rooms where Shiren is present, so if you trigger Thief Mode<br>in the room where the stairs is located, you're more likely to be in the clear.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="preparations">Preparations</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Fort. Staff can be used to block off a hallway beforehand to ensure a safe path to the stairs room.</p>
            <p>You can line up and paralyze an enemy so that a Swap Staff can be used from inside the shop,<br>but note that a different enemy can end up being between you and the paralyzed enemy.</p>
            <p>Pickaxes and Boring Staff can be used to create diversions for Shopkeeps, but remember that enemies<br>in Shiren 5 tend to walk straight in hallways until they bump into a wall or another enemy.</p>
            <p>Always sell your inventory items right before stealing, but note that tagged equipment lose their tags when sold.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="risk-free">Risk-Free</h2>
          <h3 id="zalokleft-pot">Zalokleft Pot</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Place the merchandise you want to steal so that it's lined up with the shop's entrance, step outside the shop,<br>and open the Zalokleft Pot while facing the items. (Note that you can't steal pots)</p>
            <p>The game doesn't count this as stealing, so Shopkeeps won't become hostile.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="coupon-scroll">Coupon Scroll</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Read the scroll to transform all merchandise in shops into regular floor items.<br>Remember that you can write it on Blank Scrolls if you've read it once. (See <a href="/shiren5/system/tanuki-passwords">Tanuki Passwords</a> for obtaining one)</p>
            <p>Don't forget to sell your inventory items before reading it.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="black-hole-pot">Black Hole Pot / Pit Trap</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>The classic method where you create a Pit Trap inside a shop and step on it after picking up merchandise.<br>However, this only works in dungeons with descending stairs, so it won't work in main story dungeons.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="transient-reflection">Transient Staff + Reflection Pot + α</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>This method requires more items, but is also guaranteed.<br>Insert an item into a Reflection Pot, pick up merchandise, and swing a Transient Staff at the Shopkeep to warp to the stairs.</p>
            <p>Check to make sure an enemy isn't positioned on the stairs before swinging the Transient Staff,<br>and keep in mind that this method can't be used if you have the Magi-Twister shield rune.</p>
            <p>The +α is something that can block or cancel Paralyzed status on the spot, and includes:</p>
          </div>
          <ol class="desc_list">
            <li>Immunity Scroll, blessed Peach, Chakra Cleanse (ability)<br>The safest options. Nullifies or immediately cures Paralyzed status.</li>
            <li>Monsterphobic<br>You'll take damage if an enemy is present in the stairs room, cancelling the paralysis.<br>However, there's the possibility of getting attacked by an enemy who is adjacent to the stairs.</li>
            <li>Starving status<br>You'll take 1 damage per turn while starving, which can be used to cancel the paralysis.</li>
            <li>Revival Grass or Undo Grass<br>Cancel the paralysis by collapsing and being revived. Very wasteful, so not recommended.</li>
            <li>Juicy Peach<br>Eat it beforehand, and cancel the paralysis by getting hit by an attack.<br>(Blessed Juicy Peaches let you survive 2 fatal hits)</li>
            <li>Invincible Grass<br>Use it right before swinging the Transient Staff, and then cancel the paralysis by getting attacked.<br>It doesn't last the entire duration of paralysis, so it might fail if enemies aren't present in the stairs room.</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ MC Mage can be used instead of Transient Staff + Reflection Pot.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="floaty">Floaty</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Lure 3 Floaty family monsters into a shop, and get launched to a different floor after picking up merchandise.</p>
            <p>Floaty family monsters were buffed in Shiren 5 (higher attack, Swift status with 1 attack) so it's tricker than in Shiren 4,<br>but items like Slow Talisman + Inacc. Talisman can increase the success rate.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="monster-spawn-limit">Monster Spawn Limit</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>There can be a maximum of 20 creatures on a floor, including Shiren and the Shopkeep.<br>So if you trap 18 monsters in a room using a Fort. Staff, new Shopkeeps won't spawn even after triggering Thief Mode.<br>Paralysis Staff can be used in place of a Fort. Staff, but they'll begin to flow out of the room when Thief Mode is triggered.</p>
            <p>Floaty, Naptapir, and Moseal monsters won't move unless Shiren interacts with them, so they're easy to use for this method.</p>
            <p>You can generate monsters without waiting for natural spawns by using items like Monster Pot,<br>Zalokleft Pot, Pot Dog Scroll, Monster Trap, and Summon Trap.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="new-items">New Items</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>New items can make stealing completely trivial.<br>For example, you can simply swing a Transient + Swap effect staff to safely warp to the stairs.<br>If you're worried, check for enemies using a Monster Detector, eat Swift Grass beforehand, etc.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="some-risk">Some Risk</h2>
          <h3 id="wall-clip-bracelet">Wall Clip Bracelet + α</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Effective when the stairs is along the wall and close to the shop, but be careful of current HP. (10 damage per turn in walls)<br>You might need to cover exiting the wall with a different item, such as a Swap Staff from inside the wall.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="boring-staff">Boring Staff / Rusty Pickaxe + α</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Create a straight path to the stairs if the shop is lined up with the stairs,<br>and then travel through the path using different items to take shortcuts if possible.<br>Can be helpful to paralyze the pursuing Shopkeep using a Paralysis Staff.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="pinning-staff">Pinning Staff</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Leap to the stairs using a Pinning Staff. You might need to use a Fort. Staff if the stairs isn't along the wall.<br>Use a Monster Detector to make sure there are no enemies in the stairs room to avoid new Shopkeeps spawning.<br>Equip a Can. Arm Bracelet and use arrows from inside the shop to clear out enemies if needed.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="swap-staff">Swap Staff</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Position an enemy on the stairs using a Paralysis or Transient staff, and switch places with them using Swap Staff.<br>If the stairs is lined up but a wall is in the way, equip a Can. Arm Bracelet and throw the Swap Staff instead.<br>Monster Detector helps ensure you don't accidentally switch places with an unintended enemy.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="staff-of-sacrifice">Staff of Sacrifice</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>The log deals 10 tiles of knockback, so use that to quickly make your way to the stairs.<br>Same issue as Swap Staff, where an enemy could get in the way in a hallway.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="dangerous">Dangerous</h2>
          <h3 id="clone-staff">Clone Staff + α</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Swing a Clone Staff at Shopkeeps you encounter in hopes of distracting them long enough to gain distance.<br>Success rate is pretty low, since you often get sandwiched inside a hallway.<br>It helps to use items like Paralysis Staff, Swap Staff, Slumber Scroll, etc.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="gamblers-scroll">Gambler's Scroll</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Read Gambler's Scrolls and hope for the floor warp effect.<br>Might be better as a last-ditch effort when you're about to get caught with no escape.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="night-abilities">Night Abilities</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Shut down Shopkeeps using Sticky Shot and Pot Party.<br>Generally successful if you make it to the stairs room, but it's common to get sandwiched in hallways.<br>Unlike Shiren 4, Three Screams, Transmogrification, and Last Stand are ineffective against Shopkeeps.</p>
            <p>If you have Invincible Grass or Revival Grass, you can use Crawling Confusion + Pot Party to almost guarantee success.<br>If you don't have such items, you could try Swift Grass + Hilarious Pot, or Fort. Staff to block paths.<br>However, keep in mind that Laughing status from a Hilarious Pot will cancel Hiding status from Pot Party,<br>so wait until all Shopkeeps are laughing before using Pot Party.</p>
            <p>If you get sandwiched in a hallway, use Whack and Warp or Warp Grass to escape the situation.<br>No matter what abilities and items you end up using, don't step on a Monster Cure Trap or Rage Trap in the same room.</p>
