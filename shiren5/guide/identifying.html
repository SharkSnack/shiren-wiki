          <h2 id="notes">Methods</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Identification of items can be generally categorized into 5 main methods.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="yolo">YOLO (You Only Live Once)</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Technique where you use the item and determine what it is based on its effect.<br>It carries the risk of using a negative item, but is one of the basic methods of identification.</p>
            <p>Every item category except bracelets and pots can be identified, but scrolls and grass items are consumed,<br>and you won't know how many uses a staff has left, so it's not a method that always guarantees complete identification.</p>
            <p>It's best to perform this method right before you advance to the next floor to reduce the impact of negative effects.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="price">Price</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Technique where you narrow down possibilities based on an item's price.<br>It doesn't consume the item and there's zero risk, but doesn't guarantee identification.</p>
            <p>You can gain insight into every item in your inventory, so players who learn how to do this will have a great advantage,<br>especially in dungeons like <a href="/shiren5/dungeon/primordial-chasm">Primordial Chasm</a> and <a href="/shiren5/dungeon/heavenly-lake">Heavenly Lake</a> where shops always appear on specific floors.</p>
            <p>Narrowing down possibilities by price also makes it easier to apply other identification methods to the item.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="identify-scroll">Identify Scroll</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Reliable method that guarantees complete identification of any item category.<br>It's important to make smart use of <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#identify-scroll">Identify Scrolls</a> since you generally won't have too many opportunities to find them.</p>
            <p>The ideal way to use an Identify Scroll is to give it to a Shopkeep to identify all merchandise inside a shop,<br>especially in dungeons where shops always appear on specific floors. (Note that the Identify Scroll must be identified)<br>If you have enough Gitan to buy items back, go ahead and sell your items before giving the scroll to identify more items.</p>
            <p>If you choose to read the scroll, it's best to use it on item categories that are hard to identify using the YOLO method.<br>Many pots can be identified by inserting an item, and combined with price identification, you can identify nearly every pot.<br>So the cases in which you read the scroll on a pot are limited:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li><a href="/shiren5/item/pots#synthesis-pot">Synthesis Pot</a> hasn't been identified yet, and you found a pot with a capacity of 5 and it'll be a while before you see a shop.</li>
            <li>You found a pot with a capacity of 2 that could be a <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#blessing-pot">Blessing Pot</a> or <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#dodger-pot">Dodger Pot</a>, and want to avoid wasting a use.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>On the other hand, there are many bracelets that can't be immediately identified when equipped, and there's<br>significant risk in equipping a cursed bracelet, so they're generally the best category for reading an Identify Scroll.</p>
            <p>Reading an Identify Scroll occasionally results in a lucky use that identifies all items that aren't inside pots,<br>so it's best to take items out of pots and read it only when you have many unidentified items.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="identify-pot">Identify Pot</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Multiple items can be identified, but you need to shatter the pot to retrieve items, and it can't identify pots.<br>It's best to insert bracelets, but it's sometimes better to just use it instead of carrying it in anticipation of finding more bracelets<br>since it takes up an inventory slot that could be held by a different item.</p>
            <p>If you've already identified key bracelets like <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#monsterphobic">Monsterphobic</a> and <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#mojo-bracelet">Mojo Bracelet</a>, go ahead and insert scrolls and grass.<br>It can also be used like an <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#ordinary-pot">Ordinary Pot</a> to hold items you won't need until later, such as items for Mixer synthesis.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="mixer-synthesis">Mixer Synthesis</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Items that are successfully synthesized using Mixers are automatically identified in this game.<br>This is fantastic for grass items, since many grass items offer more value when synthesized compared to being used.</p>
            <p>If one item used in synthesis is already identified, the resulting item will be identified as well.<br>This is especially important to remember when synthesizing staves to reveal use counts.</p>
