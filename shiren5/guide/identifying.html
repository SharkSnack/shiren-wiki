          <h2 id="notes">Methods</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Identification of items can be generally categorized into 5 main methods.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="yolo">YOLO</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>"You only live once" technique where you just use the item and determine what it is based on its effect.<br>It carries the risk of using a negative item, but is one of the basic methods of identification.</p>
            <p>Every item category except bracelets and pots can be identified, but scrolls and grass items are consumed,<br>and you won't know how many uses a staff has left, so it's not a method that always guarantees complete identification.</p>
            <p>It's best to perform this method right before you advance to the next floor to reduce the impact of negative effects.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="price">Price</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Technique where you narrow down possibilities based on an item's price.<br>It doesn't consume the item and there's zero risk, but doesn't guarantee identification.</p>
            <p>You can gain insight into every item in your inventory, so players who learn how to do this will have a great advantage,<br>especially in dungeons like <a href="/shiren5/dungeon/primordial-chasm">Primordial Chasm</a> and <a href="/shiren5/dungeon/heavenly-lake">Heavenly Lake</a> where shops always appear on specific floors.</p>
            <p>Narrowing down possibilities by price also makes it easier to apply other identification methods to the item.</p>
            <p>(See <a href="/shiren5/item/price-chart">Price Chart</a> for looking up the price of items)</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="identify-scroll">Identify Scroll</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Reliable method that guarantees complete identification of any item category.<br>It's important to make smart use of <a href="/shiren5/item/scrolls#identify-scroll">Identify Scrolls</a> since you generally won't have too many opportunities to find them.</p>
            <p>The ideal way to use an Identify Scroll is to give it to a Shopkeeper to identify all merchandise inside a shop,<br>especially in dungeons where shops always appear on specific floors. (Note that the Identify Scroll must be identified)<br>If you have enough Gitan to buy items back, go ahead and sell your items before giving the scroll to identify more items.</p>
            <p>If you choose to read the scroll, it's best to use it on item categories that are hard to identify using the YOLO method.<br>Many pots can be identified by inserting an item, and combined with price identification, you can identify nearly every pot.<br>So the cases in which you read the scroll on a pot are limited:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li><a href="/shiren5/item/pots#synthesis-pot">Synthesis Pot</a> hasn't been identified yet, and you found a pot with a capacity of 5 and it'll be a while before you see a shop.</li>
            <li>You found a pot with a capacity of 2 that could be a <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#blessing-pot">Blessing Pot</a> or <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#dodger-pot">Dodger Pot</a>, and want to avoid wasting a use.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>On the other hand, there are many bracelets that can't be immediately identified when equipped, and there's<br>significant risk in equipping a cursed bracelet, so they're generally the best category for reading an Identify Scroll.</p>
            <p>Reading an Identify Scroll occasionally results in a lucky use that identifies all items that aren't inside pots,<br>so it's best to take items out of pots and read it only when you have many unidentified items.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="identify-pot">Identify Pot</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Multiple items can be identified, but you need to shatter the pot to retrieve items, and it can't identify pots.<br>It's best to insert bracelets, but it's sometimes better to just use it instead of carrying it in anticipation of finding more bracelets<br>since it takes up an inventory slot that could be held by a different item.</p>
            <p>If you've already identified key bracelets like <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#monsterphobic">Monsterphobic</a> and <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#mojo-bracelet">Mojo Bracelet</a>, go ahead and insert scrolls and grasses.<br>It can also be used like an <a href="/shiren5/item/pots#ordinary-pot">Ordinary Pot</a> to hold items you won't need until later, such as items for Mixer synthesis.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="mixer-synthesis">Mixer Synthesis</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Items that are successfully synthesized using Mixers are automatically identified in this game.<br>This is fantastic for grass items, since many of them offer more value when synthesized compared to being used.</p>
            <p>If one of the items being used in synthesis is already identified, the resulting item will be identified as well.<br>This is especially important to remember when synthesizing staves to reveal use counts.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="bracelets">Bracelets</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>The most difficult item category to identify.<br>Many bracelets can't be immediately identified by being equipped, and you risk equipping a cursed bracelet<br>such as <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#nonary-bracelet">Nonary Bracelet</a> or <a href="/shiren5/item/bracelets#itemphobic">Itemphobic</a>, so you should never equip a bracelet in situations where you can't unequip it.</p>
            <p>Identify Pots and Identify Scrolls should ideally be used for bracelets, but you often end up relying on price identification.<br>Most bracelets can be identified on the spot if you know the price, excluding 3,000G bracelets.</p>
            <p>Bold bracelet names below mean the bracelet can be identified without knowing the price,<br>many of which are identified by equipping the bracelet and throwing an item or taking a number of steps.</p>
            <p><span class="emphasis">2,000G</span><br>Equip the bracelet and throw an item to determine which bracelet it is.</p>

          </ol>
          <h2 id="staves">Staves</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Most staves can be identified by swinging them at a monster.<br>Price identification can still be used to narrow down possibilities, but it's mostly used to check remaining uses.</p>
            <p>Swing the staff from at least 2 tiles away in case it's a Glorious, Swift, or Electric staff,<br>and it's best to give it a try when there's only 1 enemy nearby in case it's a Pinning or Swap staff.<br>Don't swing staves when your HP is below 26 in dungeons where Shocking Staff can appear. (Onigiri Hollow, Old Road, etc.)<br>The ideal target is a Lv2 monster such as Pit Mamel so that you can identify Unlucky Staff.</p>
            <p>Staves that can't be identified right away include Empathy, Balance, Nagging, Ordinary, and Sharing staves.<br>Sharing Staff can be identified after swinging by checking Shiren's current state. (<a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#empathetic">Empathetic</a> status)<br>Empathy Staff can be identified by taking damage from an enemy attack.<br>There's no way to identify Balance, Nagging, or Ordinary staves by swinging them, but Ordinary Staff<br>can be identified using Mixer synthesis. However, none of them are really worth taking up inventory space.</p>
            <p>If the magic bullet inflicts <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#slow">Slow</a> status, it could either be a Mage or Slow staff,<br>so you'll need to swing the staff a few more times to determine which one it is.<br>Mage Staff is far more common between the two, so if you find multiple staves, it's likely a Mage Staff.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="talismans">Talismans</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Talismans can be identified by throwing them at a monster, and can't be identified by price because they all cost 600G.<br>Don't throw talismans at groups of enemies if Enraged, Furious, Swift, and Glorious talismans haven't been identified,<br>unless you're standing on the stairs and ready to advance to the next floor.</p>
            <p>It's best to throw them at Pit Mamels early game in hopes of one of them being a Glorious Talisman.<br>Moseals and Froggos are safe targets to test talismans, as they either don't move or don't attack.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Reading a scroll identifies all other instances of that scroll, so they're mainly identified by using them.<br>It's safest to read them while standing on the stairs right before advancing to the next floor in case it turns out<br>to be a dangerous scroll like Muzzled, Grounded, Attraction, Mnster House, etc., but you could also read it<br>while standing on an entrance tile of a room if you're hoping for a Mnster House Scrl.</p>
            <p>Scrolls that have you select an item should be used on secondary weapons or shields that you don't mind losing.<br>You can synthesize the item if it was Plating, Fate, or Earth, but can't reclaim your main equipment if it was Sale or Onigiri.<br>Scrolls that cost 200G are always Identify Scrolls, so you could save selection-based scrolls until you come across a shop.<br>Identify Scrolls are pretty common, so you could try using a selection-based scroll on a pot if it's early game too.</p>
            <p>Mixer synthesis isn't a reliable method to identify scrolls, since there are very few scrolls that can be synthesized.<br>Scrolls swallowed by Mixers also turn into Wet Scrolls if they couldn't be synthesized, making them unusable until they dry off.<br>If you insist on using Mixer identification, only throw scrolls that cost 800G (Desert Scroll) or 3,000G (Lost Scroll).</p>
            <p>It's possible to check if a scroll is a selection-based scroll without consuming the item by attempting to read it<br>at night without a light source, or while Shiren is afflicted with <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#blind">Blind</a> status.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="grass">Grass</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It's best to identify grass items using a combination of price and Mixer synthesis methods instead of using them,<br>especially since many grass items offer powerful runes such as Anti-Fire, Anti-Floating, Sedating, etc. when synthesized.<br>It'll require you to keep notes on the side, but you can identify suspicious grasses by throwing them at enemies too,<br>such as when you want to check if a 500G grass is Rage Grass without using it yourself.</p>
            <p>If you prefer to use them to identify them, it's safest to use grasses while standing on the stairs to the next floor<br>without enemies around, since you'll often end up being afflicted by a negative status condition.<br>Note that you can lose <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#awakened-ish">Awakened-ish</a> or <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#super">Super</a> status when you receive a negative status condition.</p>
            <p>On rare occasions, you might encounter wicked grasses such as Amnesia Grass, Imabikiso, and SuperUnlucky Seed.<br>They're mostly found in shops, but remember that night monsters, Maneaters, Snacky, and Munchy drop shop items.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="pots">Pots</h2>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>There are many types of pots, and a lot of them are useful, so it's important to identify them without being too wasteful.<br>"Open" type pots can be identified by using them, and "Insert" type pots can often be identified by price.<br>It's not too difficult to figure out what the pot is if you insert an item, even if you don't know the price,<br>and the capacity of the pot serves as a hint as well.</p>
            <p>You'll want to identify Preservation Pot as quickly as possible early game, so remember that having<br>the courage to insert items into pots without waiting to encounter a shop can be beneficial at times.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p><span class="emphasis">600G</span><br>They all have a capacity of 3~5.<br>Selecting "Insert" will immediately identify Hide Pot, and insert an unidentified item to identify the others.</p>

            <li>Shiren gained <a href="/shiren5/system/status-conditions#hiding">Hiding</a> status = Hide Pot [3~5]</li>

            <p>4-2-8 Pots are automatically identified when thrown against a wall, so if a pot is either an Ordinary or 4-2-8 Pot,<br>go ahead and assign the name "Ordinary Pot" from the item book name list and throw it against the wall.</p>
            <p>Preservation Pot can be identified by attempting to buy an item from a Peddler NPC when your inventory is full.</p>
            <p><span class="emphasis">1,000G</span><br>Identified right away by inserting an item other than Gitan, except for pots with a capacity of 3 in shops.<br>The inserted item is very likely to be lost, so don't insert anything important.<br>A capacity of 2 is always a Black Hole Pot, and is never sold in shops.<br>These pots generally aren't too useful, so you don't need to go out of your way to identify them.<br>However, you'll want to use an Identify Scroll if you see a pot with a capacity of 3 in shops, since it could be a Fever Pot.</p>

            <li>Nothing happened after changing floors / inventory item was cursed or sealed = Unlucky Pot [3~5]</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>If you don't know the price of a pot, insert an unidentified item that isn't a talisman. (Talismans can't be blessed or sealed)<br>Doing so checks for Preservation, Identify, Black Hole, Curse, Blessing, Perceptive, Zen, Reflection, Dodger, Sale,<br>Presto, Floramorph, and Sticky pots.</p>
            <p>Synthesis Pot is the most important pot among those that can't be immediately identified by inserting an unidentified item.<br>It can be identified by inserting 2 items that can be synthesized together, but there's risk of losing valuable items.<br>They always have a capacity of 5, so go ahead and insert extra items into pots that have a capacity of 4 or below,<br>and insert extra weapons, shields, or staves (Mage Staff is a good option), or wait until you encounter a shop.</p>
            <p>The key to not being too wasteful is to limit your attempts to identify pots as you pick them up.<br>Important pots include Preservation, Identify, Blessing, Synthesis, Black Hole, Dodger, Reflection, and Zen.<br>Once these pots are identified, you can pretty much ignore all other unidentified pots,<br>so don't fill your inventory with unidentified pots or waste Identify Scrolls at that point.</p>
