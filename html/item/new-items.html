          <h3 id="creating">Creating New Items</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Insert an item into a secret pot located in the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki, and wait for random abilities to get added.<br>The abilities are added at midnight, and change each day for 7 days. Once it reaches day 8, the item turns into Weeds.</p>
            <p>New Items can be created from weapons, shields, bracelets, grass, staves, scrolls, and talismans.<br>Other item categories like pots, food, arrows, rocks, and torches can't be inserted into secret pots.</p>
            <p>New Items are automatically registered when they're taken out of a secret pot, and up to 64 items can be registered at a time.<br><span class="warning_text">Registered items can't be erased,</span> with the exception of the oldest item being erased when you exceed the 64 item limit.</p>
            <p>They also appear in some dungeons that don't allow carry-in items, so they can easily break the balance of the game.<br>Therefore, it's highly recommended to make two save files - one with New Items, and one without.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="time_adjustments">Time Adjustments</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>The idea is to adjust console time to skip having to wait until the next day in real time.<br>Some players feel using these methods is cheating, so take that into account whether you perform them or not.<br>(However, Shiren 5 is primarily a single-player game, so you'd only be souring your own experience)</p>
          </div>
          <h4 id="" class="emphasis">DS</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Simply advance the console time 1 day at a time, checking the secret pot after each change.<br>※ If you try to return to a previous date, the item will turn into Weeds.</p>
          </div>
          <h4 id="" class="emphasis">PS Vita</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It's possible to change the date while playing, including both advancing and returning to previous dates.</p>
            <p>Example:<br>Insert an item on 7/10, and while on that screen, press the PS button → change date to 7/17 in settings → check the secret pot.<br>If you don't like the result, you can go back 1 day and check the secret pot on 7/16, all the way back to 7/11.<br>If you then feel like the result on 7/14 was the best, you can change the date back to that date and register that item.<br>Perhaps you didn't like any of them, in which case you can take out the item on 7/11 (if unchanged) and reinsert the item.</p>
            <p>That said, if any of the dates of inserted items go in the negative, all items will turn into Weeds.<br>So it's best to insert items into secret pots at the same time when they're all empty, rather than inserting across different dates.</p>
            <p>For those that have a PS Plus subscription or a PC and don't mind more blatant cheating,<br>you can create a backup of your save data before inserting items, and reload if you didn't like any of the results.<br>This lets you retry immediately without having to spend time strengthening equipment or reaquiring rare items.</p>
          </div>
          <h4 id="" class="emphasis">Switch</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>(To be determined)</p>

          </div>
          <h3 id="stats_abilities">Stats and Abilities</h3>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>The base item's upgrade value, runes, use count, blessing, etc. are ignored.<br>Stats and abilities are returned to their base values the moment the item is inserted.</li>
            <li>The abilities that get added are selected at random, and some abilities are more common than others.<br>This can easily be seen when you insert bracelets, where cheaper bracelet abilities like Bunch Bracelet<br>or Can. Arm Bracelet are common, but abilities like Wall Clip Bracelet or VIP Bracelet are very rare.</li>
            <li>Scrolls and staves have categories for abilities, and only same category abilities will get added.
              <ul>
                <li>Scrolls are split into selection and non-selection abilities.<br>Effects like Fate Scroll will never get added to a base item that doesn't have a selection such as a Confusion Scroll,<br>and selection-based scrolls will only gain selection-based abilities.</li>
                <li>Staves are split into those that fire magic bullets, and those that don't.<br>Staves that fire magic bullets will only gain abilities that fire magic bullets, and vice versa.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The number of added abilities can increase as days pass, up to a max of 3 abilities.
              <ul>
                <li>The number of added abilities will never decrease as days pass.</li>
                <li>Multiple abilities can get added in a single day.<br>Example: Two days without any added abilities, and then suddenly gain 3 abilities the next day.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many added abilities are based on existing items, but some abilities are exclusive to New Items.
              <ul>
                <li>Some existing item abilities will never get added to New Items, such as Floating Bracelet.<br>So if you want a New Item bracelet with the Floating Bracelet effect, you have to insert a Floating Bracelet.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Weapon and shield stats have variance.
              <ul>
                <li>Base attack or defense can have a max increase of +15.</li>
                <li>Upgrade limit and rune slot count are included in this variance.</li>
                <li>There are 6 outcomes when it rolls for stats. (Bad, Bad Rare, Normal, Normal Rare, Good, Good Rare)<br>If the previous day rolled Bad, the next day can roll Bad, Bad Rare, Normal, Normal Rare, Good, or Good Rare.<br>If the previous day rolled Normal, the next day can only roll Normal, Normal Rare, Good, or Good Rare.<br>If the previous day rolled Normal Rare, the next day can only roll Normal Rare or Good Rare.<br><span class="important_text">So basically, stats won't get worse as days pass</span>.<br>※ Upgrade limit and rune slot count have ranges for each roll rather than a set value, so you might see them decrease.<br>　Example using Ordinary Stick's upgrade value: Bad = 50~55, Normal = 53~58, so if you roll Bad and get 55,<br>　and then roll a Normal and get 53 the next day, the value decreased despite being a better roll.</li>
                <li>Bad, Normal, and Good rolls are shared between base attack or defense, upgrade limit, rune slot count, and ability count.<br>On the other hand, base attack or defense, upgrade limit, and rune slot count have their own rolls for Rare.</li>
                <li>For ability count, Bad = 0~1, Normal = 2, and Good = 3</li>
                <li>Lastly, the chance for better rolls increases as days pass, and inserting higher level equipment also boosts said chance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Possible values for weapon and shield stats are based on equipment level, so always insert Lv8 equipment.</li>
            <li>Resonance is based on the base item. (example: Strength Bracelet as a base, resonates with Counter Shield)</li>
            <li>Inserting a Fixer Scroll as a base allows you to read the New Item scorll without light at night.</li>
          </ul>
