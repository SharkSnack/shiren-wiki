          <h3 id="expect_the_worst">Expect the Worst</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>The mantra of a rougelike is "Hope for the Best, Expect the Worst".<br>Generally, the more you plan for negative situations, the further you'll be able to progress.</p>
            <p>Example thoughts:</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
              <li>What if I don't find food from this point on?</li>
              <li>Even stronger monsters might appear after this floor.</li>
              <li>Is my equipment good enough?</li>
              <li>I see the stairs, but there might be a hidden trap on the way to it.</li>
              <li>I might be underleveled to advance to the next floor.</li>
            </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>There's really an endless list of thoughts or worries that can cross your mind, so it's similar to driving,<br>where you prepare for and are ready to react to situations. (example: a squirrel running across the road).<br>It's important to be aware of what has the potential to occur at any given time, and act accordingly.</p>
            <p>That said, you don't want to overdo the thinking to the point of getting stuck in decision paralysis.<br>Overthinking can lead to mistakes as well, so don't stress or worry too much, and enjoy the gameplay.</p>
            <p>The key to the main story is to recognize when you're reaching your limit, and escape as needed to regroup.<br>No one will give you a hard time for escaping, even if it's on a early floor.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="missed_throws">Have a Backup For Missed Throws</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Projectiles and thrown items have a roughly 84% chance to hit the target.<br>The chance for 3 projectiles or thrown items to hit the target in a row is less than 60%.</p>
            <p>So it's good to think of follow-ups like leading a monster onto a nearby trap before throwing the item.<br>If a dangerous monster is adjacent to you, it's best to use a staff or scroll instead of relying on a thrown item.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="careful_around_enemies">Move Carefully Near Enemies</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Many monsters have troublesome abilities and special attacks, so even one missed step can lead to a collapse at times.<br>So be careful of your inputs, and don't move without intention when there are enemies around.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="dont_dash">Don't Dash in Dangerous Places</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Dashing makes it quicker to navigate dungeons.<br>However, as nice as it is, don't dash in dangerous situations like at night, or on floors where dangerous monsters appear.<br>Really, it might be best to avoid dashing at all times to prevent accidents.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="scout_command">Use the Scout Command</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Seeing what monsters are in a room lets you create an informed plan to either fight or run.<br>Finding out that there was a DJ Mage or Pop Tank family monster after getting hit<br>by their special attack will be too late to prevent a loss or collapse.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="diagonal_movement">Use Diagonal Movement</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>One diagonal movement is equal to 2 orthogonal movements.<br>It's important to get used to using diagonal movement to conserve fullness, and to limit monster spawns.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="missed_inputs">Common Missed Inputs</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Inserted main equipment into a Presto Pot</dt>
            <dd>Often occurs when you're tired, or nervous in late game floors.<br>Remember that the cursor moves to the top when you press right while viewing the item you're standing on.<br>Perhaps it's best to make a habit of selecting the item with R before inserting.</dd>
            <dt>Threw an item at a Shopkeep while identifying</dt>
            <dd>Often occurs when you're naming items while checking a price chart, and usually results in a failed adventure.<br>Place items away from the Shopkeep, or make a habit to face away before opening your inventory.</dd>
            <dt>Pressed B+L to Scout, but shot an arrow instead</dt>
            <dd>Make a habit to press B before L. (Pressing B alone doesn't end your turn)<br>However, that will make you dash instead of scout if you miss the L input.<br>Perhaps it's best to always select the Scout option from the menu, instead of using shortcuts.<br>※ Use the right analog stick to scout on the PS Vita version.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h2 id="food_related">Food Related</h2>
          <h3 id="">Restoring Fullness</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It might seem like food items you find on the ground or buy from shops are the only ways to restore fullness at first,<br>but there are a number of other ways to either restore fullness or obtain items that restore fullness.</p>
            <p>Eating to restore fullness:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Onigiri -- 50</li>
            <li>Large Onigiri -- 100</li>

            <li>Squid Sushi Scroll -- 40</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Other methods to restore fullness:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Read a Fixer Scroll while starving -- fully restored</li>
            <li>Revive using Revival Grass, Undo Grass, or Wanderer Rescue -- fully restored</li>

            <li>Get hit by a peach or grass item thrown by a Kappa Pest, Vexing Kappa, or Kappa Troll -- varies by item</li>

            <li>Stay at an Inn (Hermit's Hermitage or Sparrow's Inn) -- fully restored</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Methods to obtain food / increase restoration amount:</p>

            <li>Grill Rotten Onigiri (30 → 60), Onigiri (50 → 60), Dog Onigiri (50 → 60), or Special Onigiri (30 → 60)<br>※ Fullness restoration decreases if you grill Large Onigiri or Huge Onigiri.</li>
            <li>Throw a Rotten Onigiri or Special Onigiri at a Kid Squid family monster to create a Squid Sushi Scroll (30 → 40)<br>※ Other onigiri items work, but fullness restoration decreases.</li>
            <li>Trigger a Decay Trap while a monster is standing on the trap. -- Rotten Onigiri<br>※ Works on Floating type monsters too.</li>
            <li>Splash Water on a monster afflicted by Onigiri status -- Rotten Onigiri<br>※ Mostly used with the Onigiri Bonanza ability.</li>
            <li>Splash Water on a Hard Peach (30 → 50) or Peach (50 → 100)<br>※ Juicy Peach works, but it'll turn into a Rotten Peach.</li>

            <li>Place unneeded items (single rocks, single arrows, etc.) on the ground in a room with a Field Knave -- Weeds</li>
            <li>Talk to <a href="">Tao</a> when you're starving to buy an Onigiri for 500G</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="">Ripening Peaches</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Changing floors ripens peaches outside of pots in the order of Hard Peach → Peach → Juicy Peach → Rotten Peach.<br>It takes 3 floors to ripen a Hard Peach into a Peach, and 2 floors for the others.</p>
            <p>Water also ripens a peach by 1 stage, and floor count isn't reset when a peach ripens due to water.<br>(example: Peach will become a Juicy Peach next floor, ripen it using water, it'll become a Rotten Peach next floor).<br>Water sources include Water Pots, walking on water using a Waterwalk Bracelet, and tsunamis in the DS version.<br>Decay traps will always transform a peach into a Rotten Peach.</p>
            <p>Juicy Peaches restore the most fullness, but a regular Peach cures negative status conditions and restores strength,<br>and also grants the powerful <a href="">Immune</a> status when blessed, so remember that when managing ripeness using pots.<br>Rotten Peaches can be thrown at enemies to lower attack and defense.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="eating_order">Eating Priority</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>If you don't have a pot to store food in, it's best to eat food that restores a lot of fullness first<br>to reduce the loss from stepping on a Decay Trap.</p>
            <p>If you have a pot to store food in, or there's no risk of stepping on a Decay Trap,<br>it's best to eat food that restores the least amount of fullness first to free up inventory space.</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Get hit by fire or explosion damage to grill all onigiri in your inventory that aren't inside pots.</p>
            <p>Zen Pots can be used to grill onigiri without receiving damage from fire or explosions.<br>The Anti-Blast※ rune will make you unable to grill onigiri using explosions.</p>

          <h3 id="">Inacc. Bracelet + Decay Trap</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Equip an Inacc. Bracelet → lure a monster onto a trap → throw an item or shoot an arrow.<br>This works on Floating type monsters as well, excluding Flamebird family monsters since their body burns items.<br>(However, if you inflict the Flamebird with <a href="">Cloned</a> status, you can trap them)</p>
            <p>Use this technique with a Decay Trap to create lots of Rotten Onigiri.<br>The Rotten Onigiri can either be grilled, or thrown at a Kid Squid monster to make a Squid Sushi Scroll.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Killer Arrow + Decay Trap</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Similar to the previous technique, but shoot a Killer Arrow instead of equipping an Inacc. Bracelet.<br>(Killer Arrows have very low accuracy)</p>

          <h3 id="">Shoot Arrows in Hallways</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Many dungeons have limited field of view in hallways.<br>If you don't have a Monster Detector, Monsterphobic, Scout Bracelet, or Navigation Scroll, you're at risk of running<br>into monsters and getting hit by an attack before you're able to react, which can result in a collapse.</p>
            <p>So in an effort to avoid that, shoot an arrow or throw an unneeded item into the hallway before entering it.<br>If the item either hit or missed a monster, go ahead and wait for the monster to enter the room from the hallway.<br>If there wasn't a monster, it's usually safe to enter the hallway, but you'll want to periodically shoot an arrow<br>or throw an item while navigating the hallway to ensure a monster isn't approaching.</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Some monsters are effectively immune to projectiles due to their special abilities.<br>However, you can still hit them with projectiles if you equip a Can.

          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Mixer family --- Swallows items and synthesizes them. (Number of items it can swallow varies by level)</li>

            <li>Bored Kappa family --- Throws items back at you. (Item categories it can throw varies by level)</li>
            <li>Flamebird family --- Its body burns projectiles and thrown items.</li>
            <li>Grass Boy, Pin Kid families --- Covers itself in grass when a grass item is thrown at it.</li>
            <li>Froggo family --- Thrown Gitan heals it instead of dealing damage. (Also applies to Gitan with piercing properties)</li>
            <li>Gyaza family --- Converts damage and effects from items into 2 damage. (Also applies to items with piercing properties)</li>
          </ul>

            <p>※ Items will hit sleeping Mixers and Sweet Nuts.<br>　It's easy to make this mistake, since sleeping Mixers swallowed items in some of the previous games in the series.<br>※ The number of grass items Grass Boys can cover themselves in is equal to their level.<br>　(Limit broken Grass Gramps and grass items with piercing properties haven't been tested)<br>※ Kojirouta's Gitan throw special attack has piercing properties and heals Froggos.</p>

            <p>1. Special attack<br>　Can be shut down by statuses besides Sealed, including Afraid, Confused, etc.<br>　Examples: Nigiri Morph's breath, Fearabbit's attraction, Dragon's fire breath.</p>
            <p>2. Special ability<br>　Can only be shut down by Sealed status.<br>　Examples: Mixer swallowing items, Gyaza converting effects into 2 damage, Shagga's multi-attack.</p>
            <p>3. Innate characteristic<br>　Cannot be shut down, even by Sealed status.<br>　Examples: FO-U's 1 damage conversion, Flamebird burning items or multiplying from explosions,<br>　Floating types being able to move on void tiles, Aquatic types being able to move on water tiles.</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Seedies were significantly buffed in this game, and are now on par with Shiren 4's Chintalas.<br>They have the same stats as Colum, and require a hit-and-away strategy when you don't have a shield.<br>Basically attack once, retreat a few steps until your HP recovers, and then attack again.<br>They're mostly a non-issue once you reach level 2, or if you have a shield equipped.</p>

          <h3 id="">Mudkin - Unequip Equipment</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Mudkin family monsters can lower upgrade value and erase runes, but are harmless when nothing is equipped.<br>They can multiply when hit by attacks including arrows, so they're tricky to dispatch even from a distance.<br>So the best method to deal with them without consuming Seal Staff uses is to unequip your equipment.<br>You can unequip both weapon and shield in 1 turn by inserting them into a pot using multi-select.<br>They can still multiply when you punch them bare-handed, but the chance is pretty low, so it's not a big problem.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Swordsmans - What's behind you?</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Ally NPCs always dodge flying equipment in Shiren 5, but other monsters can be hit by flying equipment.<br>So it's best to fight Swordsman family monsters with your back against a wall to minimize risk of losing equipment.</p>
            <p>On a related note, disarmed equipment will have piercing properties if you have a Can. Arm Bracelet equipped<br>or if you've eaten Dracon Grass on the current floor, so be extra careful if either of those cases apply.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Grass Boy - Zigzag Movement</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Grass Boy family monsters will throw grass at you from a distance when you're lined up with them.<br>If you approach them in a straight line, you're bound to get hit by their attack, so use diagonal movement instead.<br>This basic technique is also used against Boy Cart family monsters, DJ Mage family monsters, Dragons, etc.</p>

          <h3 id="">Tag Equipment in Dungeons</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>You can tag equipment by talking to the Shopkeep inside a dungeon shop, or by reading a Tag Scroll.<br>Nice option if you find a rare item in a post-game dungeon, but don't think you can clear the dungeon to take it home.</p>

          <h4 class="emphasis">Duplicate Using Wet Scrolls</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Different scrolls can be used to duplicate items if they're transformed into Wet Scrolls beforehand.<br>The resulting scrolls will be the same item as the first Wet Scroll you inserted when they dry off.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
          </div>
          <ol class="desc_list">
            <li>Insert a Wet Scroll (Blank) → Wet Scroll (Exorcism) → Wet Scroll (Vacuum Slash).</li>

          </ol>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>How to create Wet Scrolls:</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a Mixer monster swallow a scroll.</li>
            <li>Pour water on a scroll using a Water Pot.</li>
            <li>Walk on water tiles using a Waterwalk Bracelet.</li>
            <li>Get caught in a tsunami. (DS version only)</li>

          <h4 class="emphasis">Duplicate Using 2 Items</h4>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Useful for duplicating rare items like True Knife, Onigiri Shield, Wonder Pick, etc.</p>
          </div>
          <ol class="desc_list">
            <li>Have a Gyandora or Gyandoron peck a Fever Pot.</li>
            <li>Use 2 Pot God Scrolls on the Fever Pot [0].<br>(Items won't be duplicated with a pot size of 1)</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Fastest method is to level up a Gyadon located in Tower of Fortune 2~3F.<br>However, it can't peck the pot if your shield has the Anti-Peck rune, and its attacks are painful without a shield.<br>You can temporarily erase Anti-Peck, use Poison Arrows, unequip your shield and use a Klein Pot, etc.</p>

            <p>Using a Pot God Scroll on a pot that has dirt in it will still add 1 to its size, but the expanded slot will be dirt.<br>The grass items that result from dirt will never be blessed or sealed.</p>

            <p>Unlike Shiren 4, Revival Grass will activate even when its inside a pot, so you can make use of otherwise negative<br>pots like Unbreakable Pot by keeping Revival Grass (and Undo Grass) in them instead of discarding them.</p>

            <p>Reading a blessed Extraction Scroll will bless all items that are extracted from a pot, and the scroll will be consumed.<br>So as long as one of the items in the pot is a Blank Scroll or Extraction Scroll, you can create a blessed item loop.</p>
            <p>There are many uses for this technique, including rapidly increasing equipment upgrade value or level (explained further down),<br>blessing items like Pot God Scroll, Fixer Scroll, Expulsion Scroll, Angel Seed, Revival Grass, Undo Grass, etc.</p>
            <p><a href="">Gen's Turf</a> and <a href="">Page of Youth</a> offer many opportunities to obtain Blank Scrolls through monster licenses,<br>so this technique isn't necessarily limited to dungeons that allow carry-in items.<br>(Create a blessed Extraction Scroll by writing Blessing and Extraction on two Blank Scrolls to get started)</p>

            <p>Equipping a Mojo Bracelet allows you to land critical hits, with the chance being based on the number<br>of cursed or sealed items in your inventory. (excluding items in pots)</p>
            <p>Critical hit rate = 5 * x * y + 10%, where x = number of cursed or sealed items, and y = number of Mojo Bracelets.<br>(So 18 items to reach 100% with 1 bracelet, or 9 items with 2 bracelets)</p>
            <p>Methods to curse or seal items:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Curse Scroll</li>
            <li>Curse Pot</li>
            <li>Imabikiso (rare grass item, place items you don't want cursed or sealed on the ground first)</li>
            <li>Curse Trap (place items you don't want cursed or sealed on the ground first)</li>
            <li>Curse Girl family special attack (place items you don't want cursed or sealed on the ground first)</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ Use Poison Grass, Poison Arrow, Rotten Peach, etc. when relying on a Curse Girl's special attack.<br>※ Use Perception Grass, Trapper Bracelet, Trap Scroll, Mnster House Scrl, Multiplication Trap, Karakuroids to find a trap.</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>See <a href="">Gameplay Basics</a> for an overview of synthesis mechanics.</p>
            <p>That page details Mixer synthesis item category priorty, how to remove curses or retain blessings when synthesizing,<br>and status conditions that prevent Mixers from swallowing items.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Sub Weapon / Shield</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>If your main weapon or shield doesn't have any open rune slots, go ahead and synthesize runes onto a second<br>weapon or shield to free up inventory space, and then synthesize that later after your main weapon or shield levels up.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Identify Using Mixers</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Items that get synthesized with a weapon or shield by a Mixer are identified on the spot.<br>(So the next time you come across that item, it'll be identified)</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Expand Mixer's Stomach</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Throw a Stomach Expander at a Mixer to increase the number of items it can swallow by 1. (or 2 if blessed)<br>This can be repeated up to a max of the Mixer being able to swallow 8 items.<br>※ Stomach Expanders must be thrown while the Mixer can still swallow items. (example: Before Mixermon swallows 3 items)<br>※ The Mixer powers up for every Stomach Expander you throw as well, so be careful when fighting it.</p>

          <h2 id="">Dungeon Tricks</h2>
          <h3 id="">Warping</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Sometimes it's faster to warp out of a bad situation, or to a different location on the floor if the stairs is across the map.<br>This is especially true when speedrunning, or when you're trying to quickly get through floors during the night.</p>
            <p>Methods include:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Warp Grass</li>
            <li>Blink Bracelet</li>
            <li>Waterwalk Bracelet (unequip while on a water tile)</li>
            <li>Floating Bracelet (unequip while on a water or void tile)</li>
            <li>Pinning Staff (jump toward a water or void tile)</li>
            <li>Staff of Sacrifice (get hit by the log onto a water or void tile)</li>
            <li>Swap Staff (swap places with a monster on a water or void tile)</li>
            <li>Land on a water or void tile after getting knocked back by a Yanpii family monster</li>
            <li>Land on a water or void tile after getting hit by DJ Mage's magic bullet (knockback effect)</li>
            <li>Get hit by DJ Mage's magic bullet (warp effect)</li>
            <li>Get hit by MC Mage's magic bullet (transient effect)</li>
            <li>Swing a Transient Staff at a monster while the floor has Reflection status (best with Chakra Cleanse ability)</li>
            <li>Whack and Warp (ability)</li>
            <li>"Surrounded" ability <a href="">formation</a></li>
            <li>Black Hole Pot (not a warp, but advance to the next floor using Pit Traps if the dungeon has descending stairs)</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ Deeper floors have greater risk, so it's best to use items like Swift Grass or Invincible Grass before warping.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Waiting for Day / Night</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Certain dungeon floor ranges are organized in a way where it's safer to progress either during the day or at night,<br>which means you'll need to know how to safely change the time of day to make the most of the monster table.<br>(Also, the Stairlight <a href="">ability</a> can only be used at night, which reveals the location of the stairs on the map)</p>
            <p>The safest method is to read a Night-Day Scroll, but you likely won't come across that scroll often,<br>and there are usually better uses for a Blank Scroll, like throwing an Extinction Scroll<br>at the troublesome monster you're trying to avoid in the first place.</p>
            <p>Some methods:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Place a Sanctuary Scroll to create a safe space in a dead end room / hallway.</li>
            <li>Paralyze enemies using a Paralysis Staff or Paralyzing rune to create a safe space in a room / hallway.<br>※ Only on floors where Absorbiphant family monsters don't appear.</li>
            <li>Place Gitan on the ground and have a Froggo family monster stand on it to block a room entrance / hallway.<br>※ Level 1-3 only.</li>
            <li>Deal enough damage to an Explochin family monster to make it stop moving to block a room entrace / hallway.</li>
            <li>Place an item on the ground and have a Bored Kappa family monster stand on it to block a room entrance / hallway.<br>※ Stand outside of their throw range, level 1-3 only. (Lv1: 3 tiles, Lv2: 5 tiles, Lv3: 10 tiles)</li>
            <li>Use a Knockback Staff to have a Moseal family monster block a room entrance / hallway.</li>
            <li>Use a Fort. Staff to block a room entrance / hallway.</li>
            <li>Equip a Wall Clip Bracelet and create a safe space inside a wall using a pickaxe or explosion.</li>
            <li>Equip a Waterwalk Bracelet and wait in a waterway.</li>
            <li>Equip a Floating Bracelet and wait in a waterway or over a void tile.</li>
            <li>Enemies tend to walk straight in Shiren 5, so dig a loop + a branch to the side, and wait inside the branch.<br>※ Doesn't have to be a dug out one, naturally generated terrain works too.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ Pumphantasm family monsters can approach you from inside walls.<br>※ Don't try to wait on floors where monsters have long-range or floor-wide attacks.<br>　(examples: Porgon's rock throw, Archdragon's fire breath, Horrabbit's attraction, Kappa Troll's item throw, etc.)<br>※ Aquatic type monsters can enter the room from a different spot besides the entrance if there are waterways.</p>

          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>By far the fastest way to level up allies to Lv99, and works on 3 allies at a time.</p>
          </div>
          <ol class="desc_list">

            <li>Bless the Angel Seeds using the blessed Extraction Scroll loop. (explained earlier on this page)</li>
            <li>Equip a True Knife + Anti-Parry Brce. to activate a resonance effect that ensures thrown items always hit their target.<br>※ Can be skipped if you don't mind missing.</li>
            <li>Bring Dracon Grass, or equip a Can. Arm Bracelet if you're not using 100% accuracy resonance.</li>
            <li>Go to Destiny Trail with the 3 allies you want to level up, and line them up in a hallway.</li>
            <li>Eat the Dracon Grass, and throw the blessed Angel Seeds to increase ally levels by 6 per throw until Lv99.</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>※ Koharu levels up through equipment level, rather than experience points.<br>※ Glorious Staff and Glorious Talisman only grant 500 experience points.</p>

          <h3 id="">Level Up Monsters</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>It can be beneficial to intentionally level up a monster to farm specific items or obtain lots of experience points early on.<br>It's important to weigh the risks and consider the items you have on hand before going for it.</p>
            <p>If Shiren's actions level up a Swift monster, the monster can still move or attack 1 time on the same turn.<br>(example: swinging a Glorious Staff)<br>If a Swift monster's actions cause it to level up, it won't be able to move or attack after it levels up.<br>(example: defeating a different monster due to Berserk status)</p>
            <p>Some level up methods:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="desc_list">
            <li>Swing or throw a Glorious Staff.</li>
            <li>Throw a Glorious Talisman, Cheery Grass, or Angel Seed.</li>
            <li>Swing a Clone Staff and have another monster defeat the monster with Cloned status.</li>
            <li>Throw a Berserker Tal. or Rage Grass and have the Berserk status monster defeat another monster.</li>
            <li>Throw a Fear Talisman or read a Fear Scroll and have the Afraid status monster defeat another monster.</li>
            <li>Throw a Conf. Talisman, read a Confusion Scroll, throw Confusion Grass, or trigger a Spin Trap<br>and have the Confused status monster defeat another monster.</li>
            <li>Throw Blinding Grass or trigger a Blind trap and have the Blind status monster defeat another monster.</li>
            <li>Have a monster stand between you and the target monster so the target monster's attacks hit the monster.<br>※ Pop Tank family monsters won't fire cannonballs if the explosion won't hit you, even if you're lined up.<br>(examples: Boy Cart's arrows, Yanpii's tackle, Dragon's fire breath, Moseal's tackle)</li>
            <li>Wait for a monster to use their special attack so that another monster takes damage.<br>(examples: Tiger Tosser's throw, Foly's lightning)</li>
            <li>Have a monster defeat an ally character.</li>
            <li>Be revived by the <a href="">Boy's Sister</a> NPC.</li>

                <li>If you only have 1 level up item, have a Pit Mamel defeat a Colum so that the Colum rolls and defeats another monster,<br>resulting in the Pit Mamel leveling up twice and turning into a Gitan Mamel.</li>

                <li>Innate Slow status, but has high attack and a lightning counter attack.<br>It also has high defense, so you might not be able to damage it at low levels or with a weak weapon.</li>

            <li>Boy Cart family + Dodger Pot
              <ul>
                <li>Dodger Pot makes all projectiles miss, so simply collect all of the arrows that land on the ground.<br>However, arrows that miss can trigger traps when they land on them, so don't forget to check for traps beforehand.</li>
                <li>Use items like Slumber Scroll, Swift Foe Scroll, Swift Staff, Swift Talisman, Swift Grass for increased efficiency.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Boy Cart family + Bored Kappa
              <ul>
                <li>Position the Bored Kappa so it's between Shiren and the Boy Cart family monster,<br>and then collect all of the arrows the Bored Kappa catches and throws at Shiren.</li>
                <li>Don't apply Swift status to the Bored Kappa.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Boy Cart + Strong shield
              <ul>
                <li>Equip a strong shield and step in place to get hit by Boy Cart's arrows, and collect all of the arrows that miss.<br>If your HP gets low, enter a hallway to regenerate HP.</li>
                <li>Shiren takes 1~4 damage with Shoddy Plank (30 def), and 1 damage with Glass Buckler (35 def),<br>so you can use either shield to farm arrows by intentionally sealing it beforehand.<br>It can also be done using Lv8 Targite (25 def), Red Shield (27 def), or Fuuma Shield (30 def) + some upgrade value.<br>Hard Peach, Rotten Peach, Poison Arrow, Poison Grass, or Super status's defense up can make up for lower defense.</li>
                <li>Usually end up with about 1 stack of arrows if performed until the wind blows, but doing so depletes a lot of fullness.</li>
                <li>Can be performed on any floor where Boy Cart or Pop Tank family monsters appear if you use an item like Unlucky Staff.</li>

            <li>Notes about stepping on arrow traps
              <ul>
                <li>Arrow traps have 100% accuracy, and stepping on traps can cause you to lose Super or Awakened-ish status,<br>so you'll generally want to use the thrown item method instead of any of these, unless you don't have items<br>or don't want to waste valuable Fort. Staff uses.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dodger Pot
              <ul>
                <li>Dodger Pot causes even arrow traps to miss, so simply dodge the arrows and pick them up.<br>Missed arrows won't land on the trap underfoot, so the trap can only be triggered one time per turn.<br>Therefore similar to Fort. Staff, it's quite wasteful to use a Dodger Pot for Wood or Iron arrows,<br>as opposed to saving it for higher level Scoopie, Bored Kappa, Mutaikon, or Porky family monsters,<br>or collecting Knockback Arrows using a Strong Cart.</li>

            <li>Mixer
              <ul>
                <li>Step on the trap so that Mixer swallows the arrows that fly at you, and then defeat the Mixer.<br>Extremely inefficient, so consider it more of a bonus than a realistic method to collect arrows.<br>That said, it could be useful in <a href="">Bizarre Tower</a> on floors where Mixers have very high spawn rates.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bored Kappa
              <ul>
                <li>Place an item 3 or more tiles away so that the Bored Kappa stands on it without throwing it,<br>and then step on the trap so that the Bored Kappa catches the arrow and throws it toward you.<br>If you're too close, the thrown arrow will land on the trap underfoot and cause you to get hit by an arrow.</li>
              </ul>

            <li>Iron Door
              <ul>

          <ol class="spaced_list">
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Check the room for traps.</span><br>Any trap can cause problems, but you especially don't want to step on a Pit Trap or Monster Trap.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Prepare items on the ground.</span><br>After checking for traps, shoot arrows or throw rocks at a wall to separate them into single items.<br>If you want to increase max fullness from 100 → 200, you'll need to eat 25 Large Onigiri when you're full. (26 total)<br>It's best to stock up on a couple of extra Large Onigiri for the road too, so aim for 28 items or so.<br>Of course, feel free to adjust the quantity based on other inventory items or play style.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Trade items to add them to inventory.</span><br>Hold B and move onto an item to step on it without picking it up, and trade the item with an inventory item.<br>This lets you pick up items like single arrows or rocks without them automatically getting grouped together.<br>※ Don't sort your inventory after doing this, or else all single arrows and rocks will get grouped together.</p>
              <p>Inventory should be equipment, Poison Arrows or Poison Grass, and items to be turned into onigiri.<br>※ Your equipped weapon, shield, and bracelets will never be transformed into an onigiri by a Nigiri Morph,<br>　but set arrows, rocks, staves, and talismans can be transformed, so don't carry anything you want to keep.</p>
              <p>It's sometimes better to place the rest of your items in a different location, depending on the monster table.<br>(example: Place items in the stairs room on 22F of Onigiri Hollow, since Grass Bros can throw Warp Grass)<br>※ Remember where you place important items in case you need to use them in an emergency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Have Nigiri Morph transform inventory items.</span><br>Once the above preparations are complete, it's time to transform items into Large Onigiri.<br>If you're receiving too much damage, don't hesitate to use Poison Arrows, Poison Grass, Slow Staff, etc.<br>Poison (Weakened status) in particular has a drastic effect, lowering damage dealt by 50% at stage 1.<br>Step in place if you can tank the hits, or circle around the room to regenerate HP as you get hit by its attacks.<br>※ Be careful not to pick up your other items while circling around the room.</p>
              <p>Trade the onigiri with other single arrows or rocks, or place / throw the onigiri on the ground during the process.<br>Once you've obtained the number of onirigi you were aiming for, defeat the Nigiri Morph to finish up.</p>
            </li>

          <h4 id="" class="emphasis">Tips / Cautions</h4>
          <ul class="spaced_list">
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Leveling up a Nigiri Baby</span><br>This is a non-issue if you use items like Cheery Grass, Glorious Staff, or Glorious Talisman.</p>
              <p>However, when you don't have such items, you can use the current floor's monster table to your advantage.<br>Froggo and Moseal commonly appear alongside Nigiri Baby, and both are easy targets to use as level up fodder.<br>Place Gitan on the ground to control Froggo's position, and Moseal has high HP, so it's good to damage it a bit first.<br>Moseal is better for Cloned status, and Froggo is better for Afraid and Berserk statuses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Using a Poison Arrow Trap</span><br>Shooting Poison Arrows to lower Nigiri Morph's attack is standard practice, but they can deal too much damage<br>if you've leveled up, have increased your max strength, or have boosted attack from Super status.<br>So in that case, use Poison Arrows from a Poison Arrow Trap instead, which only deals about 5 damage per hit.<br>※ The downside is that the trap might break after 1 use, and you might lose Super or Awakened-ish status.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Remember item locations</span><br>This was stated earlier, but it's worth repeating - remember where you place your items in case of an emergency.<br>All of the preparation means nothing if you collapse from not having a way to deal with a different monster<br>that entered the room while you were busy preparing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Beware of Tiger Tosser</span><br>Tiger Tossers appear alongside Nigiri Baby in some dungeons, and can easily ruin your plans by throwing<br>a weakened Nigiri Morph and leveling up, so be especially careful if you've used multiple Poison Arrows.<br>It's best to memorize that Nigiri Morph has 55 HP, and that Tiger Tosser's throw deals 5 damage.</p>
              <p>One way to prevent accidents is to block the room entrance using items like Fort. Staff or Paralysis Staff.<br>Froggos can also be used to block entrances - simply place Gitan down where you want the Froggo to stay.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="emphasis">Beware of Zalokleft, Grass Boy, Absorbiphant</span><br>Nigiri Morph appears alongside Green Zalokleft, Grass Bro, and Absorbiphant in many dungeons.<br>Don't let Zaloklefts steal items you've placed on the ground, and keep grass items inside pots.<br>Try to position yourself in a way that prevents an Absorbiphant from curing Nigiri Morph's status conditions.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="">Zalokleft Hunting</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Simply defeat Zaloklefts to obtain items.<br>It's best to have the Anti-Theft rune or the floor-wide effect from a Perceptive Pot to avoid getting your items stolen.<br>It's probably not worth keeping a Perceptive Pot in your inventory for this purpose, since it has few other uses.</p>
            <p>Zalokleft drops have their own item table, and generally don't include anything too special.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="">Grass Boy / Bro Hunting</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Collect grass items by defeating Grass Boy or Grass Bro monsters.<br>Excellent for obtaining grasses for Mixer synthesis, and to identify grasses early on.<br>It's best to hunt Grass Boys since Mixer usually appears soon after, but hunger can be an issue.</p>

          <h3 id="">Grass Guy / Gramps Factory</h3>
          <div class="explanation_2">
            <p>Pin Poppa and Pin Gramps have the ability to generate their own grass items,<br>so the idea is to have them throw or spread the grass they generate at Shiren to increase his stats.</p>
            <p>The point of this technique is to gain permanent stat increases, so that means you're aiming<br>for Strength Grass, Stomach Expander, Herb, Otogiriso, Heal Grass, and Life Grass.<br>However, HP regeneration slows down with higher max HP, and Nigiri Morph factory is much more<br>efficient at increasing max fullness, so this technique is mainly used to increase max strength.</p>
            <p>It's recommended to only bother with this in dungeons where Strength Grass is common,<br>or in dungeons where there aren't many negative grass items in the item table.<br>(Pitfall of Life, Underground Manor General District, Monster Hotspot, and possibly Onigiri Hollow)<br>And to reinforce this point - <span class="emphasis">it's not worth the effort to perform this technique in other dungeons.</span></p>
