              <li>Technical character that offers a mix of ranged offense and support.</li>
              <li>She appears at the entrance to Tower of Fortune as part of the story,<br>and you're given the option to hire her as a guide for 1500G.<br>(If you decline, she'll raise the price to 2000G)</li>
              <li class="ally_line">She also appears at the Beginner House in Inori Village after clearing the main story.</li>
              <li>She prioritizes following Shiren at all times.
                <ul>
                  <li>If Shiren is in view, and she isn't adjacent to him, she'll move toward him.</li>

                  <li>If she's adjacent to Shiren, and there aren't any active enemies in range, she'll do nothing.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Her special attack is a boomerang throw that deals fixed damage from a distance.
                <ul>
                  <li>It can hit enemies up to 8 tiles away, and she uses it 50% of the time if an enemy is in range.</li>
                  <li>The boomerang follows a square path, and pierces through walls and characters.</li>
                  <li>Damage dealt is equal to half of her max HP. (example: 50HP at level 1, so 25 damage)</li>
                  <li>It hits monsters like Cavel Mamel, Gitan Mamel, Mixer, Bored Kappa, Flamebird, and Sweet Nut for full damage.</li>
                  <li>She won't throw the boomerang at night.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>She'll offer to sell you an item at 5 times the regular price if you talk to her when you're in need of help.
                <ul>
                  <li>If you have cursed or sealed items → Exorcism Scroll (1500G)</li>
                  <li>If your strength has been lowered → Antidote Grass (500G)</li>
                  <li>If your fullness is at 0 → Onigiri (500G)</li>
                  <li>If it's night → Fine Torch (800G)</li>
                  <li>If it's night and you've used all abilities → Replenish Scroll (3000G)</li>
                  <li>Note: You can only buy one type of item per floor, but can buy the same item multiple times.</li>
